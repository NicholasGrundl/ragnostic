## Whey processing  
  
Whey, the liquid residue of cheese and casein production, is one of the biggest reservoirs of food protein still remaining largely outside human consumption channels. World whey output, at approximately 120 million tonnes in 1980, contains some 6.7 million tonnes of relatively high-value protein, equal to the protein contents of almost 2 million tonnes of soya beans. Yet, despite the chronic protein shortage in large parts of the world, a very considerable proportion of the total whey output is still wasted - the proportion of wastage was roughly 50% in 1989-1990.  
  
Whey comprises 80-90% of the total volume of milk entering the process and contains about 50% of the nutrients in the original milk: soluble

In concentration most of the true protein, typically > 99%, is retained together with almost 100% of the fat. The concentrations of lactose, NPN and ash are generally the same in the retentate serum and permeate as in the original whey, but a slight retention of these components is reported. The overall retention figures, however, depend very much on:  
* The type of membrane  
* The flux  
* The character of the feed (prediluted with water, pre-concentrated after demineralization, etc.)  
  
![Process for recovery of dried protein concentrate using UF.](image.png)  
  
To obtain an 85% protein concentrate the liquid whey is first concentrated 20 â€“ 30-fold by direct ultrafiltration to a solids content of approximately 25%; this is regarded as the maximum for economic operation. It is then necessary to diafiltrate the concentrate to remove more of the lactose and.
