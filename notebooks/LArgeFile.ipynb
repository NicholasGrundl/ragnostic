These simulations describe the cost efficiency of oxygen delivery as a function of oxygen uptake rate and vessel size, and show that capital and operating costs for oxygen delivery drop considerably moving from small-scale (200 m³) to world-class size (500 m³) reactors. This analysis suggests bubble-column reactor systems can reduce overall costs for oxygen delivery by 10-20% relative to stirred tanks at low to moderate oxygen transfer rates up to 150 mmol/L·h.\\n\\n## Keywords\\nAerobic fermentation\\nBioreactor design\\nCapital cost\\nGas-liquid oxygen mass transfer\"}],\"stop_reason\":\"end_turn\",\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":1142,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":0,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":0,\"output_tokens\":240}}\n",

Capital costs (uninstalled, 2014$) of STRs in 316SS as a function of agitator power.\\n\\nCompression power is required for larger volumes of air. The power scales slightly more favorably with volume at higher O2R, with a 10% power reduction between 500 m^3 and 1000 m^3. In either case, for large reactors at a given O2R, the total bioreactor system power consumption scales approximately linearly with total liquid volume. This implies that any beneficial economies of scale realized at larger vessel sizes are more strongly a result of reduced capital costs for the vessels and agitators than reduced operating costs from differences in power demand or cost efficiency.\\n\\nTo investigate the economies of scale possible for aeration, capital and operating costs were incorporated into the analysis. The bioreactor capital costs were taken from ACCE as discussed above. For STRs, these were obtained from Fig. 2 as a function of optimized agitator power. A fixed installation factor of 2.3 was used to obtain the direct cost for the bioreactors. Capital costs for compressors, pumps, and heat exchangers were also estimated using ACCE, though these were generally small compared to the reactor cost. The total capital cost was then converted to an annualized capital charge factor and $400 operating hours per year, consistent with NEL's cost flow calculation methodologies, e.g., as presented in [12] and [10]. Operating costs were calculated as the sum of electricity at $0.06/kW-h and maintenance at 6% of installed capital. The resulting aggregate OPEX plus annualized CAPEX costs were combined with the oxygen delivery rate calculated for each condition to determine the total cost per kilogram of oxygen delivered. This can be thought of as the total cost to deliver a kg of oxygen to a culture, for a single reactor and the associated equipment depicted in Fig. 1. Fig. 3b shows a specific total oxygen demand, for which capital and operating costs were normalized by reactor volume ($/m^3). Note that the costs of substantial aeration (high O2R) increase the total operating costs relative to OUR, and has been minimized here to focus on the economic trade-offs of scale.\\n\\nThe economics of scale appear to show a fairly sizable advantage in favor of BCR technology. Beyond the physical limitations studied, BCR reactors are always less expensive to operate than STRs of the same size: with values ranging ~ 10-20% reduction in $/kg O2 by use of a BCR over a STR (Fig. 3c), suggesting the diminishing economies of scale are unlikely to justify discontinuing such a large unit.\\n\\nThe above observation that O2 delivery is more cost-efficient at higher OUR has implications for the production of high-volume commodities like bulk chemicals and biofuels where extreme cost minimization is essential for techno-economic viability. For example, to make the most efficient use of fermentor capital equipment, it is important to be able to obtain and maintain a high volumetric productivity during the production phase of the target process.\\n\\nFig. 3.

The cooling tower was not\\nincluded because its power consumption is insignificant compared to\\nthe chiller.\\nThe independent variable determining total system power was\\ntaken to be the oxygen uptake rate (OUR), in an operating bioreactor,\\nthe submersed culture provides some OUR, which, at steady-state, is\\nequal to an oxygen transfer rate (OTR); the product of a mass transfer\\ncoefficient, k\\na (m h−1), times the volumetric available surface area, a, and\\nan oxygen concentration driving force, (C∗ − C).\\nOUR = OTR = k\\na a (C∗ − C)\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nwhere k\\na is usually lumped together and C∗ and C are respectively the equilibrium and the actual dissolved oxygen concentrations\\n(mol/L), the reactor design purposes, several literature sources [19] and\\nSTRs, the two-viscous mass transfer correlation of [13] is frequently\\nused as a design equation. This correlation describes k\\na as a function\\nof bioreactor vessel power input (P) per unit volume (V) and the gas\\nsuperficial velocity (v\\ng) in the reactor, i.e.\\nk\\na(s−1) = 0.002 (P/V)(vm)0.5 (v\\ng m/s)−0.2\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nwhere the pre-factor and exponents are adjustable for specific systems. This correlation is often relied on for its simplicity, as it does\\nnot depend on specific reactor geometry, or impeller speed, number,\\nand type (details the accessible range of P/V is an implied function of\\nthese [14]). The review of [15] lists other, more complex, correlations\\nfor k\\na, but notes that the original [13] (Ref correlation (Eq. (2))) is\\nthe most frequently used for basic design in non-viscous systems. Reactor sizes > 100 m3 are out of the fit space for the original correlation,\\nbut [16] developed a zoned model where the correlation was applied\\nindependently to stirred and unstirred zones within a large reactor,\\nand concluded that in the limit of good mixing (L/dk > 1000), the correlations could be simply applied to the entire volume. In many event,\\nwell proven correlations like Eq. (2) can be used to determine idealized steady-state bioreactor scenarios and make cost productions.\\nFor BCRs, [17] proposed a similar correlation, with k\\na as a primary\\nfunction of the gas superficial velocity [13], which further described\\nhow this correlation can be corrected for temperature, T, and effective\\nbroth viscosity, m\\nbr, resulting in:\\nk\\na(s−1) = 0.32 (m\\ns m/s)0.1 (m\\nbr/μP)0.84 ∗ 1.025(T-20)\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nIt should be noted that BCRs are not normally recommended for\\nfermentations where the broth viscosity is higher than 2 cP. We therefore limit our comparisons to non-viscous (aqueous) systems in the\\nscope of this study.\\nIn aerobic culture where molecular oxygen (O2) is the primary\\nelectron acceptor at the end of the electron transport chain, it can be\\nshown that the heat of reaction is proportional to the oxygen uptake\\nrate, regardless of the actual effective stoichiometry or products of\\nthe culture [18]. Approximately 100 kcal of heat is released per g-mol\\nO2 consumed, which is equivalent to the heat of reaction for an O2\\n```\"}],\"stop_reason\":\"end_turn\",\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":1142,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":0,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":0,\"output_tokens\":897}}\n",

The objective of this work is to integrate the bench-top fermentor model with existing techno-economic models in Aspen Plus and Excel to establish a new methodology for guiding process design. To assist this effort, NREL has contracted Genomatica to critique and make recommendations for improving NREL's bioreactor model and large scale aerobic bioreactor design for biologically producing lipids at commercial scale.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging the great work NREL has done to this point in developing a bioreactor model, Genomatica has highlighted a few areas for improving the functionality and effectiveness of the model. Genomatica recommends using a compartment model approach with an integrated black-box kinetic model of the production microbe. We also suggest including calculations for stirred tank reactors to extend the model's functionality and adaptability for future process designs.\\n\\nGenomatica also suggests making several modifications to NREL's large scale lipid production process design. The recommended process modifications are based on Genomatica's internal techno-economic assessment experience and are focused primarily on minimizing capital and operating costs (critical for fuel product commercial viability, see Table 1 on page 6). These recommendations include: selecting/engineering a thermotolerant yeast strain with lipid excretion; using bubble column fermentors; increasing the volume of production fermentors; reducing the number of vessels; employing semi-continuous operation; and recycling cell mass and glycerol.\"}],\"stop_reason\":\"end_turn\",\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":1180,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":0,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":0,\"output_tokens\":347}}\n",

Many other antibiotics were made via this method. Over the years, it has become a route to economically produce a variety of compounds, including enzymes, amino acids, vitamins, flavors, biofuels, think kening agents, and cleaning compounds. The list keeps growing.\\n\\nOne reason for its widespread use is its specificity for producing compounds—that is, some species are difficult to make by other means, and others may produce high concentrations of byproducts. Another reason is that fermentation requires comparatively mild conditions, in terms of temperature, pressure and pH. This often allows for less-costly equipment and lower energy costs compared with using standard chemical synthesis.\\n\\nStill, for operating fermenters as designed to minimize energy use, surprisingly little attention is given to collecting the data needed to predict the full-scale oxygen transfer and energy consumption. To make matters worse, the pilot conditions usually differ from those in the scaled-up, commercial unit. Compared with commercial equipment, pilot units operate at a much higher agitation power (power/unit mass or volume) and a much lower superficial gas velocity (actual gas flow divided by the tank's cross-sectional area).\\n\\nNonetheless, attempts are sometimes made to scale up from the limited pilot data. These can be based on an equal power per unit volume, an equal volume of gas per volume of liquid per minute (VVM), or when such a technique yields unreasonably large equipment, as it usually does, engineering judgment is employed to compensate for the increase in superficial gas velocity and pressure driving force in the full-scale equipment.\\n\\nHowever, such judgment carries some risk, since the relative contribution of agitation and airflow to mass transfer can vary considerably for different processes and different agitation systems.\"}],\"stop_reason\":\"end_turn\",\"stop_sequence\":null,\"usage\":{\"input_tokens\":1180,\"cache_creation_input_tokens\":0,\"cache_read_input_tokens\":0,\"output_tokens\":451}}\n",

Calculate the required k₂a.\\n## Step 6. Calculate the actual volumetric air flow at the agitator impeller tip. Use the volumetric flow rate to account for temperature, composition, backpressure and liquid head. Use the average flowrates for the inlet and outlet. \\n## Step 7. Calculate the superficial gas velocity at the impeller using the above as volumetric.\\n## Step 8. Using the mass-transfer relationship developed from pilot scale data, solve for the agitator power. Add about 5% to account for the gear drive and seal losses to get the required motor power draw.\\n## Step 9. Calculate compressor power. Include the backstage, liquid head, pressure, and losses from the sparging, piping and filtration systems. Also include the manufacturer's compression efficiency to calculate motor power draw required (typically 50-80%). For an existing plant, these should be calculated based on the actual piping system. For a new plant optimization study, a simplified assumption can be made: the piping system will be sized based on a certain maximum pressure drop at the inlet airflow chosen.\\n## Step 10. Calculate the total power of the agitator and the compressor.\\n## Step 11. Repeat Step 1-10 for an incremental change in airflow. An increment of 10% of the theoretical minimum is suggested.\\n## Step 12. Repeat Step 11 until a minimum total power is found. Add in safety factors to account for data errors and flexibility for future process changes.\\n\\nThis procedure is primarily designed to allow optimization of the original installed compressor and agitator power. It can also be used in an existing fermenter to compute the optimum conditions during the batch cycle, which of course, has a varying oxygen demand from beginning to end. If the airflow and agitator speed are both variable, then a control-logic sequence can be developed to minimize energy usage throughout the processing sequence.\\n\\nThis procedure may seem to involve a lot of calculation time. Of course, once the system equations have been defined, they can be put into a computerized spreadsheet so repeated calculations will take little time. The potential reward can be significant. It is not unusual for a 150,000-L fermenter to operate at 100 kW or more away from the optimum, so reducing power consumption by 25% or more is achievable.\\n\\nExample:\\nThe figure on the right shows how the power consumption varies when this procedure is used.

Normally, the iteration process would start at a value 20% higher than the literature value, but for this case, it was started at 0.02, 0.06, and 0.06, respectively, based on units of g, kW/m^3, and kw/m^2. This strategy was used to converge faster. The remaining steps in this process should be derived from values stated in the actual broth and impeller system data that will be used. Based on a required k_a of 0.0649/s and a superficial gas velocity of 0.0204 m/s, the required agitator power/V = 349 W/m^3. For a batch size of 114 M^3, this gives a total installed power of 39.8 kW. Allowing for 70% power transmission efficiency through the gear drive and seal, the motor power draw required is about 41.9 kW. This figure seems low, it is because the required OTR for this problem is low, so the \\\"easy\\\" fermentation (step 9) to calculate the compressor power, the inlet airflow and pressure are needed, as well as the outlet compressor power, assuming roughly adiabatic operation.\\n\\n# Step 4. To calculate the driving force, we need to know the absolute pressure and concentration of the air stream at the top and bottom, as well as the DO concentration in the broth at the top and bottom. The bottom pressure equals the backpressure plus liquid head: 0.68 atm + 1 atm (gage pressure) + 1.06 atm (10.97 m liquid head at 1.0 g/L) = 2.74 atm abs. Since the saturation value at 1 atm is 21% and 2.74 atm, is 7.87%, the saturation concentration at the bottom is 7.87% * (0.68 + 1.06) = 1.19 mM.\\n\\n# Step 5. The pressure at the top is 1.68 atm (abs) and the concentration of O2 is 10.4%, so saturation at the outlet is 7 mg/L + 1.68 x (10.42/1) = 5.82 mg/L. Now that saturation values have been established, calculate the driving force. To do this, the liquid DO concentrations must also be known. It has been established that a minimum of 2 mg/L is needed for the process to work effectively. However, real fermenters are not perfectly mixed, so there will be a concentration gradient.\\n\\n# Step 6. The average molar flow of gas at the middle is 0.115 + 1.109 / 2 = 1.112 gmol/min. The absolute pressure at the midpoint equals the backpressure plus half of the liquid head, or 0.68 + 1 + 0.53 = 2.21 atm. The temperature is 38°C or 311 K. Based on these lab adjustments, the actual gas flow is 24.93 x (1/2.21)(311/273) = 12.85 M^3/min.\\n\\n# Step 7. Based on the tank diameter of 3.66 M, the superficial gas velocity is 0.0204 m/s.\\n\\n# Step 8. For this example, it is assumed that the concentration of O2 in the broth and impeller system data that will be used.\\n\\nLiterature Cited\\n1. Nishino, A.

Results and discussion\\n\\n3.1. Bioreactor capital costs\\n\\nTable 1 details four comparisons between vendor quotes obtained by NRBC and costs estimated with ACCE, for medium- to large-scale STRs and BCRs and one extremely large anaerobic thermal fermentor. Only costs for bare vessels (no agitators) are compared. The \\\"vertical process vessel\\\" item from the ACCE equipment library was used for BCRs and bare STRs. The million-gallon anaerobic fermentor was approximated with the \\\"flat bottom storage tank\\\" item, since it more closely resembles physical metallurgy and design pressures are key to cost estimation because ACCE computes vessel thickness (and therefore vessel weight) from these. In storage tanks, which ACCE assumes to be liquid-full, only the pad pressure is required. In process vessels, which are not full by default, an allowance should be added for head pressure at the vessel bottom. In esterifiable vessels, design for vacuum is required by code; this requires stiffening rings inside the vessel. In ACCE, these rings effectively seem the same cost at low vacuum and full vacuum. As seen in Table 1, from a limited number of details about a vessel, and some general specification guidelines, it is possible to achieve reasonable cost agreement with vendor quotes by correctly specifying an analogous vessel in ACCE.\\n\\nUsing these guidelines, and a preference for 316 stainless steel, Table 2 presents costs for bare vessels in the standard sizes discussed in Section 2.1, along with relevant specifications provided to ACCE. Vessel perforations (e.g., nozzles and manholes) and their associated connection flanges can have a large effect on the vessel weight and therefore its cost, so these are presented as well. The STR costs in Table 2 do not include agitators. As the agitator power increases, however, the total reactor cost must increase as well, due to larger motors, gear boxes, and associated shipping infrastructure. ACCE captures this cost increase, as shown in Fig. 2, which presents the total costs of vessel and agitator for the three STR sizes in 316SS at motor powers from 10 to 2,500 hp. The ACCE \\\"agitated tank-enclosed\\\" equipment item was used to generate these costs.\\n\\n3.2. Total cost of aeration\\n\\nFig. 3 shows the power required to deliver a kilogram of oxygen in STR and BCR systems for the three vessel sizes and OTR, which are required to achieve similar specific growth rates. The power requirement is nearly constant; this is part due to the optimization of agitation and aeration powers. Furthermore, the power required to achieve a given OTR does not change significantly with vessel size (the difference between 500 m\\u00b3 and 1000 m\\u00b3 is less than 5%). For BCRs, there is a more pronounced increase for gasping power input over the same OTR range, as OTR is only controlled by aeration and other\\n```\\n\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687133, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 616, \"prompt_tokens\": 912, \"total_tokens\": 1528, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

The power scales slightly more favorably with volume at higher OTR, with a 10% power reduction between 500 m\\u00b3 and 1000 m\\u00b3. In either case, for large reactors at a given OTR, the total bioreactor system power varies approximately linearly with total liquid volume. This implies that any beneficial economies of scale realized at larger vessel sizes are more strongly a result of reduced capital costs for the vessels and agitators than reduced operating costs resulting from differences in power demand or cost efficiency.  \\n\\nTo investigate the economies of scale possible for aeration, capital and operating costs were incorporated into this analysis. The bioreactor costs data were taken from ACCE as discussed above. For STRs, the overall installation factor of 2.3 was used to obtain a total cost of the reactors. Capital costs for compressors, pumps, and heat exchangers were also estimated with ACCE, though these were comparatively small compared to the reactor cost. The total capital cost was then converted to amortized capital costs ($/h) using a 13% annual capital charge factor and 8400 operating hours per year, consistent with NREL's case study methodologies, as e.g. illustrated in [12] and [10]. Operating costs were calculated as the sum of electricity at $0.06/kWh and maintenance at 0.6% of total installed capital. The resulting aggregate OPEX post amortized CAPEX costs were combined with the oxygen delivery rate required for each combination of OUR and vessel size, yielding a $/kg O2 cost, shown in Fig. 3b. This can be thought of as the total cost to deliver a kg of oxygen to a culture.  \\n\\nFor a single reactor and the associated equipment depicted in Fig. 1, Fig. 3 shows the same data plotted in terms of the total amortized cost required to operate the system in Fig. 1 (total cost of ownership), normalized by reactor volume (S\\u2219yr\\u207b\\u00b9). Note that the cost of substrate (glucose) has not been included in Fig. 3b; substrate cost of course increases linearly with OUR, and has been omitted here to focus on the cost efficiency of O2 delivery, which is primarily a function of power.  \\n\\nThere are several conclusions to be drawn from the curves in Fig. 3c\\u2013f. First, as with the k\\u2084 concept, both above and over the OUR range studied, BCRs are always less expensive to operate than STRs of the same size, with larger savings at lower OUR. Van't Riet (1991) reached an analogous conclusion in a similar analysis (see Example 18.3). Depending upon the cost metrics assessed, k\\u2084 (supplying glucose) or S (\\u03b3) (Fig. 3c), use of BCRs reduces overall startup costs by 10\\u201320% relative to STRs, assuming the process is suitable for implementing in a BCR. Second, for both reactor types there is a significant cost advantage in scaling up from 200 to 500 m\\u00b3 and a rel-  \\n\\n**Fig. 3.** (a) Specific total power delivery; (b) specific aggregate capital and operating cost (and annual aggregate capital and operating cost to deliver oxygen in STR and BCR systems at varying vessel volume and size).  \\n\\n![](https://www.example.com)  \\n```\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687133, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 766, \"prompt_tokens\": 912, \"total_tokens\": 1678, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

Following these critical reviews, it was concluded that several assumptions pertaining to the operational performance and capital costs used in [12] erred on the optimistic side for commercial-scale aerobic fermentation.\\n\\nThis article documents efforts to reduce uncertainty in such key process and cost parameters through (1) development of an independent framework for bioreactor cost estimation that is validated against high-quality vendor quotes and (2) modeling of low-viscosity, aerobic fermentation using simple design equations and a steady-state process simulator, to understand achievable oxygen transfer rates as a function of vessel configuration, power input, and aeration rates. Together, the developments will be used to guide future refinements in conceptual design and TEA of biochemical conversion processes.\\n\\n## 2. Calculations\\n\\n### 2.1. Bioreactor capital cost estimation\\n\\nIdeally, well validated TEA studies should favor direct capital equipment inputs/quotations from equipment vendors, especially for critical and costly items like fermentors. However, external estimates are not always readily obtained for conceptual studies and can be scattered and sometimes conflicting. To facilitate rapid comparative analysis across multiple technology options, methods for cost estimation of bioreactor capital costs were developed using Aspen Capital Cost Estimator (ACCE). ACCE estimates costs for individual equipment items using volumetric models (as opposed to factored models), which compute total estimated materials and labor involved in manufacturing each equipment at a given scale. Equipment costs are then interpolated for capacity, with the addition of cost factors for shop fabrication of transportable pieces and costs for final field fabrication, all as part of a total bare equipment cost. A variety of high-quality bioreactor quotes obtained over recent years from vendors and engineering firms were used to create general guidelines for specifying fermentation vessels in ACCE, resulting in reasonably accurate, absolute capital cost predictions for both stirred-tank reactors (STRs) and bubble-column reactors (BCRs).\\n\\nWith these specification guidelines, a set of capital costs for STRs and BCRs were developed at different standard vessel volumes. Economics of scale naturally dictate use of the largest reaction vessel possible; however, while million-gallon (3800 m\\u00b3) anaerobic fermentors are in use at industrial fuel ethanol plants, the maximum practical aerobic reactor volume is less clear. Our industry contacts have intimated that the largest STRs in operation are in the hundreds of cubic meters (\\u2264500 m\\u00b3) and their ultimate maximum size must be on the order of 1000 m\\u00b3, owing to diminishing returns on oxygen transfer relative to volumetric power input, as well as practical limitations regarding the fabrication and maintenance of very large impellers, shafts, bearings, and motors. Bubble columns are not limited by moving parts and BCRs up to 1000 m\\u00b3 are known to be in operation [6]. Costs were therefore estimated for BCRs and STRs at three standard vessel sizes, with the understanding that uncertainty in costs increases with vessel size:\\n\\n- 200 m\\u00b3, representing an \\u201coff-the-shelf,\\u201d readily purchasable reactor.\\n- 500 m\\u00b3, representing a world\\u2019s-largest class of reactor that exists in relatively small numbers.\\n- 1000 m\\u00b3, representing a \\u201chypothetically large\\u201d reactor that does not exist today, representing a ceiling of what is likely viable from a design and operational standpoint.\\n\\n### 2.2. Flowshear simulation of aerobic fermentation\\n\\nTo accompany the new standard bioreactor capital costs, we carried out steady-state flowsheet simulations in Aspen Plus to estimate the economics and resource costs associated with aerobic power demand. Fig. 1 shows a flow diagram of a single STR and support equipment. The flow diagram for a BCR is identical, except for elimination of the agitator.\\n\\n![Flow diagram of a single STR and support equipment.

These simulations describe the cost efficiency of oxygen delivery as a function of oxygen uptake rate and vessel size, and show that capital and operating costs for oxygen delivery drop considerably moving from standard-size (200 m\\u00b3) to world-class size (500 m\\u00b3) reactors, but only marginally in further scaling up to hypothetically large (1000 m\\u00b3) reactors.

Introduction\\n\\nSince the development of penicillin production by submerged aerobic cultivation of *Penicillium chrysogenum*, aerobic biological production (\\u201caerobic fermentation\\u201d) has been used to produce an increasing variety of chemical products [1]. The range of products being produced or considered for biological production has grown rapidly with recent advances in metabolic engineering, synthetic biology and bio-based production technologies [2,3]. Owing largely to the relatively high cost of supplying molecular oxygen (O\\u2082) to a submerged culture, aerobic fermentation has historically primarily been applied to produce lower volume, higher value (higher margin) compounds like pharmaceuticals and specialty chemicals. The challenges to achieving commercial aerobic production become greater for larger volume, lower margin products where material and utility costs generally dominate fermentation economics [4]. The higher capital and operating costs for aerobic production are well recognized [5,6] and are also stimulating research and development on anaerobic routes for biological production [7,8]. Cost constraints become the most acute for economic aerobic production of extremely low-margin, high-volume commodity products like biofuels, and this motivated us to assess aeration costs for large-scale aerobic production in the context of such products.\\n\\nAerobic fermentation is a critical unit operation in the process of making fuel-range hydrocarbons from sugars, when the hydrocarbon is our precursor, e.g., a lipid or free fatty acid, is directly produced in submerged culture by a microorganism. However, little bio-economic information exists about state-of-the-art designs and costs of large-scale aerobic bioprocesses, especially for those producing low-margin, commodity products like biofuels where time cost minimization is required. Previous techno-economic analysis (TEA) from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) [9\\u201311] demonstrated that, in the case of absolute ethanol, the fermentative production costs stemming mechanically from the overall large aerobic fermentation vessel (up to 10 gallons) was not a primary cost contributor, generally falling behind larger cost drivers including biomass pretreatment, enzyme production/purchase, and wastewater treatment. A more recent TEA report [12] examined the aerobic conversion of lignocellulosic sugars to hydrocarbons by way of a fatty acid intermediate. In contrast to the earlier analysis [12], concluded that the aerobic fermentation area was a primary cost contributor for integrated aerobic biofuel production; in fact, it was the largest contributor of all process areas, with fermentation compressors and agitators also representing the largest power demand in the biorefinery process.\\n\\nAs the first publicly available TEA for such a technology pathway, the [12] analysis carried a higher degree of uncertainty in its underlying process design and capital cost assumptions than more established pathways. Among such uncertainties were the operating conditions, performance parameters, and cost contributions of the aerobic fermentation step. Parts of the process design were supported by a partner engineering company, which provided initial input on the design of stirred-tank aerobic bioreactors, and associated capital costs estimating. Since publication, this design has been reviewed by several engineering companies and consultants, including Harris Group, Katzen International, Benz Technologies, and Gevo.\\n\\n\\u00a9 2017.\\n```\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687133, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 974, \"prompt_tokens\": 912, \"total_tokens\": 1886, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

The cooling tower was not included because its power contribution is insignificant compared to the chiller.\\n\\nThe independent variable determining total system power was taken to be the oxygen uptake rate (OUR). In an operating bioreactor, the submerged culture provides some OUR, which, at steady-state, is equal to an oxygen transfer rate (OTR); the product of a mass transfer coefficient, k_L, a mean bubble specific interfacial surface area, a, and an oxygen concentration driving force, (C*\\u2212C_J):\\n \\nOUR = OTR = k_L a (C* \\u2212 C_J)       (1)\\n\\nwhere k_L is usually lumped together and C* and C_J are respectively the equilibrium and the actual dissolved oxygen concentrations (mmol/L). For reactor design purposes, several literature correlations are available to relate k_L to fundamental operating parameters. In STRs, the non-viscous mass transfer correlation of [13] is frequently used as a design equation. This correlation describes k_L as a function of bioreactor gassed superficial power input (P) per unit volume (V) and the gas superficial velocity within the reactor, u_G:\\n\\nk_L a [s^\\u22121] = 0.002 (P/V[m\\u00b3] x m)\\u00b2\\u2070 (u_G [m/s])\\u2070\\u00b2\\n\\nwhere the pre-factor and exponents are adjustable for specific systems. This correlation is often relied on for its simplicity, as it does not depend on specific reactor geometry or impeller speed, number, and placement, unless other correlations are utilized for these parameters. In addition, STRs cannot be made to exceed more than 1.24 hr per fermentation [20].\\n\\nTo be consistent, these simulations were run at steady state with stoichiometric glucose feed rate determined by OUR and vessel size. The reactor was modeled as a RSTIC reactor block with half vessel for roughness disengagement, CO\\u2082 and water removed in the combustion contract removed with the water and liquid product stream. Air was supplied through a compressor which was rendered by the liquid head in the reactor. In these runs, the inlet air was 70% saturated to avoid a significant makeup flow due to evaporative stripping by the sparged air. The reactor block ran adiabatically with outlet temperature maintained at 32 \\u00b0C by continuous pump-activated circulation of the liquid through a heat exchanger at a 20 \\u00b0C outlet, as noted above, depending on the specific needs for a given production organism, for example, sterility or shear stress concerns, alarming needs for temperature control may be appropriate such as vessel jacketting. This cooling power must be included empirically for real situations to finalize results based on the mass flow rate of the liquid product and any heating needs due to product build-up, requiring estimations of 1.24 hr per fermentation time.\\n\\nIt should be noted that BCRs are not normally recommended for fermentations where the broth viscosity is higher than 2 cp. We therefore limit our comparisons to non-viscous (aqueous) systems in the scope of this study.\\n\\nIn aerobic cultures where molecular oxygen (O\\u2082) is the primary electron acceptor at the end of the electron transport chain, it can be shown that the heat of reaction is proportional to the oxygen uptake rate, regardless of the actual effective stoichiometry or product of the culture [18]. Approximately 110 kJ of heat is released per g-mol O\\u2082 consumed, which is equivalent to the heat of reaction (on an O\\u2082 basis) of the process of conversion (C\\u2086H\\u2081\\u2082O\\u2086 + 6 O\\u2082 \\u2192 6 CO\\u2082 + 6 H\\u2082O). Thus, rather than assume a specific biological system product in the Aspen Plus simulation, OUR is simply taken in this work in the liquid phase, in units of mmol O\\u2082 consumed per liter per hour (mmol\\u00b7L\\u207b\\u00b9\\u00b7h\\u207b\\u00b9). For a given OUR, the simulation computed OTR from the aeration rate using Eq. (1) and the correlation for Eq. (3) (BCRs). The reactor block ran adiabatically with the air rate was then varied to set OTR equal to OUR. The STR correlation lends itself to power optimization between agitator power and gas superficial velocity (and compression); an optimization routine was used to vary these simultaneously to find the minimum total power for a given OUR. The BCR correlation cannot be similarly optimized, i.e., there is only a single u_G (and thus a single power) for a given OUR.\\n\\nSimulations were run at steady state with stoichiometric glucose feed rate determined by OUR and vessel size.

For chemical or fuel precursors produced aerobically at high productivity, the OTR requirements can be significant. The techno-economic trends show here are encouraging, as they indicate that high-OTR processes are more cost-efficient. Nonetheless, substantial challenges remain to making biofuels cost effectively via aerobic routes [21].\\n\\nThe trends established from the analysis and methodology performed here will help to define optimal operating conditions for future detailed models of aerobic processes, e.g., favoring BCRs over STRs where possible, and assessing bioreactor sizes of 500-1000 m\\u00b3. For low-margin, commodity fuels and chemicals processes, BCRs are likely more cost-effective than STR vessels based both on the present analysis as well as feedback from industry. For processes not amenable to BCRs, an optimum STR design would likely be based on a 500 m\\u00b3 vessel volume operating at an OTR above 50 mmol O\\u2082/L. Although slight improvements may be seen going to larger volumes, such reactors would be larger than commercially available units today.\\n\\n\\\\section*{4. Conclusions}\\n\\nUnfortunately in aerobic bioreactor capital and operating costs in the process design phase and TEA margins heavily leverage various biological parameters, including oxygen transfer requirements, are generally not firmly established at the time of analysis. The methods described here help to reduce the uncertainty evaluating bioreactor capital costs estimates against high-capital- vendor quotes and by using sensitivity analyses to assign quantitative uncertainty to estimates of the process efficiency of oxygen delivery in different vessel configurations. Vessel mentality and design pressure are the keys to maximizing performance while minimizing costs. \\n\\nThese observations will inform future detailed models of aerobic production. As researchers in ARIEL and elsewhere continue to identify aerobic cultures and optimize their performance, a theory-based economic approach such as the one presented here can be used to guide research.\\n\\n\\\\section*{Acknowledgments}\\n\\nThis work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DEAC36-08GO28308 with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

Regardless of the subsequent treatment of the whey, the first stage is separation of fat and casein fines, figure 15.2 \\u2013 partly to increase the economic yield and partly because these constituents interfere with subsequent treatment.\\n\\nProduction of whey powder, demineralised whey powder, lactose and delactosed whey powder predominates. However, a gradual shift is in progress towards new and interesting products that will transform the image of whey from an unwanted byproduct to an important raw material for the manufacture of quality products. Some of the products currently in use are described in this chapter.\\n\\n## Different Whey Processes\\n\\nWhey must be processed as soon as possible after collection, as its temperature and composition promote the growth of bacteria. Otherwise the whey should be quickly cooled down to about 5\\u00b0C to temporarily stop bacterial growth.\\n\\nIf legally permitted, whey can be preserved by addition of sodium bisulphite, typically 0.4% calculated as sulphur dioxide (SO\\u2082), or hydrogen peroxide (H\\u2082O\\u2082), typically 0.2% of a 30% H\\u2082O\\u2082 solution.\\n\\n## Casein Fines Recovery and Fat Separation\\n\\nCasein fines are always present in whey. They have an adverse effect on fat separation and should therefore be removed first.

It is however possible to precipitate whey proteins with acid if they are first denatured by heat. The process is divided into two stages:\\n- Precipitation (denaturing) of the protein by a combination of heat treatment and pH adjustment,\\n- Concentration of proteins by centrifugal separation.\\n\\nDenatured whey proteins can be mixed with cheese milk prior to renneting; they are then retained in the lattice structure formed by the casein molecules during coagulation. This discovery led to intensive efforts to find a method of precipitating and separating whey proteins as well as a technique for optimising the yield while retaining the characteristic aroma and texture of the cheese in question.\\n\\n![Fig. 15.5 Recovery of denatured whey proteins.]()\\n\\nFigure 15.5 shows the Centri-Whey process line for manufacture of denatured whey proteins. After pH adjustment the whey is pumped via an intermediate tank (1) to a plate heat exchanger (2) for regenerative heating. The temperature of the whey is raised to 90 \\u2013 95\\u00b0C by direct steam injection (3) before it passes through a tubular holding section (4) with a holding time of 3 \\u2013 4 minutes. Acid is introduced during this stage to lower the pH. The acid is either organic or inorganic (e.g. lactic acid or edible hydrochloric acid) as stipulated.\\n\\nThose proteins that can be, and have been, modified by heat are precipitated within 60 seconds in a tubular holding section (4).\\n\\nAfter regenerative cooling to about 40\\u00b0C the precipitated proteins are separated from the liquid phase in a solids-ejecting clarifier (6). The clarifier discharges, at intervals of about 3 minutes, the accumulated protein in the form of a 12 \\u2013 15% concentrate of which about 8 \\u2013 10% is protein. This method results in 90 \\u2013 95% recovery of the coagulable proteins.\\n\\nThe addition of concentrated whey protein to cheese milk \\u2013 principally in the manufacture of soft and semi-hard cheeses \\u2013 causes only minor changes in the coagulating properties.

The fines are often pressed in the same way as cheese, after which they can be used in processed cheese and, after a period of ripening, also in cooking. The whey cream, often with a fat content of 25 \\u2013 30%, can be re-used in cheesemaking to standardise the cheese milk; this enables a corresponding quantity of fresh cream to be utilised for special cream products.\\n\\n## Cooling and pasteurisation\\nWhey which is to be stored before processing must either be chilled or pasteurised as soon as the fat has been removed. For short-time storage, 10 \\u2013 15 hours, cooling is usually sufficient to reduce bacterial activity. Longer periods of storage require pasteurisation of the whey.\\n\\n## Concentration of total solids\\n\\n### Concentration\\nWhey concentration traditionally takes place under vacuum in a falling-film evaporator with two or more stages. Evaporators with up to seven stages have been used since the mid-seventies to compensate for increasing energy costs. Mechanical and thermal vapour compression have been introduced in most evaporators to reduce evaporation costs still further. RO (reverse osmosis) plants of tubular design have also been installed in many plants for preconcentration before the whey is sent back to the farmers and before being evaporated to final concentration.\\n\\nAfter evaporation to 45 \\u2013 65% total solids, the concentrate is cooled rapidly to about 30\\u00b0C in a plate heat exchanger and transferred to a triple-jacketed tank for further cooling to 15 \\u2013 20\\u00b0C accompanied by constant stirring. This may continue for 6 \\u2013 8 hours to obtain the smallest possible crystals, which will give a non-hygroscopic product when spray dried.\\n\\nConcentrated whey is a supersaturated lactose solution and, under certain conditions of temperature and concentration, the lactose can sometimes crystallise before the whey leaves the evaporator. At concentrations above a DM content of 65% the product can become so viscous that it no longer flows.\\n\\nFor more information on RO and evaporators see chapter 6, sections 6.4 and 6.5.\\n\\n### Drying\\nBasically whey is dried in the same way as milk, i.e. in drum or spray dryers, see under milk powder in chapter 17.\\n\\nThe use of drum dryers involves a problem: it is difficult to scrape the layer of dried whey from the drum surface. A \\u0444\\u0438\\u043b\\u044c\\u043c, such as wheat or rye bran, is therefore mixed into the whey before drying to make the dried product easier to scrape off. Spray drying of whey is at present the most widely used method of drying.\\n```\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687171, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 550, \"prompt_tokens\": 1190, \"total_tokens\": 1740, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

The process that has been most extensively used for separation of whey proteins from whey serum is heat denaturation. The precipitated protein formed by this process is either insoluble or sparingly soluble depending on the conditions prevailing at denaturation; it is called heat-precipitated whey protein (HPWP).  \\n\\nFink and Kessler (1988) state that a maximum whey protein denaturation rate of 90% is possible for all denaturable fractions. Proteose peptone, comprising some 10% of the fraction, is considered undenaturable.  \\n\\nNative whey proteins, as constituents of whey powders, can easily be produced by careful drying of whey. Because of their unfavourable composition, they have only a limited application in foodstuffs (only some 11% protein and a high lactose and ash content). Isolation of native whey proteins has therefore been developed. The native whey proteins obtained by membrane separation or ion exchange possess good functional properties, such as solubility, foaming, emulsion formation and gelling.  \\n\\nProtein recovery by UF  \\nNative protein concentrates have a very good amino acid profile with high proportions of available lysine and cysteine.  \\n\\nWhey protein concentrates (WPC) are powders made by drying the retentates from ultrafiltration of whey. They are described in terms of their protein content, % protein in dry matter, ranging from 35% to 85%. To make a 35% protein product the liquid whey is concentrated about 6-fold to an approximate total dry solids content of 9%.  \\nExample: 100 kg of whey yields approximately 17 kg of retentate and 83 kg of permeate at close to 6-fold (5.88) concentration.

Examples of such components are the bioactive proteins lactoperoxidase (LP) and lactoferrin (LF) existing at low contents in whey, typically 20 mg/l of LP and 35 mg/l of LF. The Swedish Dairies Association (SMR) has developed a patented process based on chromatography for isolation of these proteins from cheese whey on an industrial scale.\\n\\nThe basic principle underlying the process is the fact that both LP and LF have isoelectric points in the alkaline pH area, 9.0 \\u2013 9.5, which means that these proteins are positively charged at the normal pH of sweet whey, 6.2 \\u2013 6.6, while the rest of the whey proteins e.g. \\u03b2-lactoglobulin, \\u03b1-lactalbumin and bovine serum albumin are negatively charged in the same pH range. A fundamentally suitable process for isolation of LP and LF is therefore to pass a specially designed cation exchange resin for selective adsorption. The LP and LF molecules thus bind to the negatively charged functional group of the cation exchanger by charge interaction, leading to fixation of these molecules on the ion exchange resin, while the other whey proteins pass through because of their negative charge.\\n\\nTo make the process industrially viable, some basic criteria have to be satisfied. One of them is the need for a \\u201cparticle-free\\u201d whey to maintain a high flow rate during the loading phase, because very large volumes of whey have to pass the ion exchange resin to achieve saturation. Cross-flow microfiltration (MF) with a pore size of 1.4 \\u00b5m operated under a uniform transmembrane pressure (UTP) has proved to be a successful technique for getting particle-free whey. Stable flux of 1 200 \\u2013 1 500 l/m\\u00b2h is easily sustained for 15 \\u2013 16 hours. This type of pretreatment of the whey avoids build-up of increasing back pressure over the ion exchange column.\\n\\nThe ion exchange resin has a capacity to adsorb altogether 40 \\u2013 45 g of LP and LF per liter of resin before breakthrough occurs. With a resin bed volume of 100 l, almost 100 000 l of whey can be treated per cycle.\\n\\nWith properly chosen conditions for elution of adsorbed bioactive proteins on the column it is possible to obtain very pure fractions of LP and LF. Salt solutions of different strengths are used for this step. The proteins in the elutes occur in fairly concentrated form, of the order of 1% by weight. The ion exchange step thus concentrates LP and LF by a factor of almost 500 compared to the original whey. Further processing of the eluates by UF and diafiltration yields very pure protein products, appr. 95% purity. Finally, after sterile filtration in a cross-flow microfilter with 0.1 \\u2013 0.2 \\u00b5m pores, the protein concentrates are spray dried. The overall process is illustrated in figure 15.6.\\n\\n## Lactose recovery\\n\\nLactose is the main constituent of whey. There are two basic methods of recovery, depending on the raw material:\\n- Crystallisation of the lactose in untreated but concentrated whey;\\n- Crystallisation of lactose in whey from which the protein has been removed by UF or some other method before concentration.\\n\\nBoth methods produce a mother-lye, molasses, which can be dried and used as fodder. The feed value can be increased considerably if the molasses is desalinated and if high-quality proteins are added.\\n```\\n\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687171, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 765, \"prompt_tokens\": 1190, \"total_tokens\": 1955, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

The dried sugar is transported by air at a temperature of 30\\u00b0C, which also cools the sugar. The crystals are normally ground to a powder immediately after drying and are then packed.\\n\\n### Refining of lactose\\nA higher degree of purity is required for some applications, e.g., pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. Lactose for such use must therefore be further refined. During refining the lactose is re-dissolved in hot water to a concentration of 50%. Active carbon, phosphate and a filtration agent are added at the same time. After filtration the lactose solution is transferred to a tank where crystallisation takes place. The purified lactose is then separated, dried, ground and packed.\\n\\n### Demineralisation (Desalination)\\nAs whey has a fairly high salt content, about 8 \\u2013 12% calculated on dry weight, its usefulness as an ingredient in human foods is limited. By having the whey demineralised, various fields of application can however be found for whey which is partially (25 \\u2013 30%) or highly (90 \\u2013 95%) demineralised. \\n\\nPartially demineralised whey concentrate can for instance be used in the manufacture of ice-cream and bakery products or even in quarg, whereas highly demineralised whey concentrate or powder can be utilised in formulations for infants and, of course, in a very wide group of other products.\\n\\n### Principles of demineralisation\\nDemineralisation involves removal of inorganic salts together with some reduction in the content of organic ions such as lactates and citrates.\\n\\nThe partial demineralisation is mainly based on utilisation of cross-flow membranes specially designed to \\\"leak\\\" particle species that have radii in nanometer (10\\u207b\\u2079 m) range. This type of filtration is called nanofiltration (NF).\\n\\nThe high degree desalination is based on either of two techniques:\\n- Electrodialysis\\n- Ion exchange\\n\\n### Partial demineralisation by NF\\nBy using a specially designed \\\"leaky\\\" RO membrane small particles like certain monovalent ions, e.g. sodium, potassium, chloride and small organic molecules like lactic acid can escape through the membrane together with the aqueous permeate. This membrane process is known by various names such as ultramosis, \\u201cleaky\\u201d RO and nanofiltration (NF).\\n\\nBecause of their greater compactness, spiral wound membranes are most often used in new installations today (1994). For further information about this type of membrane see chapter 6.4, membrane filters.\\n\\nDairy Processing Handbook/chapter 15\\n```\\n\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687175, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 649, \"prompt_tokens\": 1190, \"total_tokens\": 1839, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

The equilibrium is characterised by a constant. On regeneration the reaction is reversed when the sodiumladen ion exchange resin is treated with, say, a 4% hydrochloric acid solution. The high concentration of hydrogen ions in the acid drives the equilibrium to the left.\\n\\nThe equilibrium constant varies depending on ion species, which gives the selectivity of ion exchange processes. Generally speaking, multivalent ions have higher selectivity than monovalent ones and ions of the same valence are selected by size, large ions having higher selectivity. For cations typically found in dairy process streams, selectivity decreases in the order Ca2+>Mg2+>K+>Na+.\\n\\nSimilarly, anion exchange selectivity can be classified in the following way: citrate\\u2013> HPO4 2\\u2013> NO3 \\u2013> Cl\\u2013.  \\n\\nIn practice this means that the ion exchanger, after being exhausted by a liquid containing different ion species, will exist in different forms along the length of the column as described in figure 15.10. This figure shows what happens in a column treating ordinary raw water in a cation exchanger loaded in the hydrogen ion form. The situation after regeneration with acid is also shown. It can be seen that the ions that remain longest in the cationexchange column are Na ions. This can be understood from the selectivity order described above.\\n\\nGoing back to the picture of the exhausted cation-exchange column in the figure, the segregated distribution of ions means that Na ions leak first, followed by Mg and Ca ions. An initial ion leakage in the exhaustion phase may occur when the ion exchanger is not fully regenerated, but after a while the Na ions are eluted and replaced by H ions (see figure 15.10).

Whey is circulated through the dilution cells, and a 5% brine carrier solution through the concentration cells. \\n\\nWhen direct current (DC) is applied across the cells, cations attempt to migrate to the cathode and anions to the anode as shown in figure 15.9. However, completely free migration is not possible because the membranes act as barriers to ions of like charge. Anions can pass through an anion membrane, but are stopped by a cation membrane. Conversely, cations can pass through a cation membrane but not an anion membrane. The net result is depletion of ions in the whey (dilution cells). The whey is thus demineralised, to an extent determined by the ash content of the whey, residence time in the stack, current density and flow viscosity.\\n\\nThe electrodialysis plant can be run either continuously or in batches. A batch system, which is used for demineralisation rates above 70%, can consist of one membrane stack over which the process liquid, e.g. whey, is circulated until a certain ash level is reached. This is indicated by the conductivity of the process liquid. The holding time in a batch system can be as long as 5 \\u2013 6 hours for 90% demineralisation at 30 \\u2013 40\\u00b0C. Pre-concentration of the whey to 20 \\u2013 30% DM is desirable with regard to capacity utilisation and electric power consumption. The whey concentrate should be clarified before it enters the electrodialysis unit.\\n\\nThe high process temperature means that there is a risk of bacteriological growth taking place in the product. A bacteriostatic compound such as hydrogen peroxide is therefore often added to the whey, when allowed. The process liquid heats up during the process, so a cooling stage is needed to maintain the process temperature. In a continuous plant, consisting of five membrane stacks in series, the holding time can be reduced to 10 \\u2013 40 minutes. The maximum demineralisation rate of such a plant is often limited to about 60 \\u2013 70%. In relation to capacity, the installed membrane area is much larger in a continuous plant than in a batch plant.\\n\\nAn electrodialysis plant can easily be automated and furnished with a programmed CIP system. The cleaning sequence normally includes water rinse, cleaning with an alkaline solution (max. pH 9), water rinse, cleaning with hydrochloric acid (pH 1) and a final water rinse. A typical cleaning programme takes 100 minutes.\\n\\nDairy Processing Handbook/chapter 15\\n```\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687181, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 604, \"prompt_tokens\": 1190, \"total_tokens\": 1794, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

The ion exchange columns are rinsed and regenerated separately with dilute hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide (ammonia). Once a day the columns are disinfected with a small amount of active chlorine solution.\\n\\nThe following net reactions take place during demineralisation (NaCl is used to illustrate the salts of whey and R represents the insoluble resin exchange site).  \\nCation exchange: R \\u2013 H + Na+ + Cl- \\u21cc R \\u2013 Na + H+ + Cl-  \\nAnion exchange: R \\u2013 OH + H+ + Cl- \\u21cc R \\u2013 Cl + H2O  \\nThe various flows in the ion exchange process include the following steps:  \\n- **Exhaustion**  \\n  10 \\u2013 15 bed volumes of whey can be treated per regeneration.

They differ in the spatial arrangement of the hydroxyl group at the C atom in the glucose molecule, and thereby also, amongst other things in:\\n- Solubility\\n- Crystal shape\\n- Melting point\\n- Physiological effect\\n\\nLactose can be split hydrolytically, i.e. by bonding of water, or by an enzyme. The lactose-splitting enzyme \\u03b2-galactosidase belongs to the hydrolase group. Figure 15.14 shows enzymatic splitting of lactose into galactose and glucose.\\n\\n![Chemical structure of lactose and lactose splitting.](#)\\n\\nLactose is not nearly as sweet as other types of sugar. This is shown in figure 15.15, which indicates the relative degree of sweetness of different types of sugar. Hydrolysis of lactose consequently results in considerably sweeter products.\\n\\nSome people lack the enzyme that decomposes lactose and therefore cannot drink or eat any significant quantities of milk products. This is called lactose intolerance. Hydrolysis of the lactose in the milk products allows these people to utilise the high-quality proteins, vitamins, etc. in milk products.\\n\\nSome defects, such as sandy texture in ice-cream (crystallisation of lactose) are practically eliminated by lactose hydrolysis.\\n\\n## Enzymatic hydrolysis\\nFigure 15.16 shows a process for enzymatic hydrolysis of lactose in whey. Pretreatment in the form of demineralisation is not essential, but it improves the taste of the final product. After hydrolysis the whey is evaporated. A syrup with a dry solids content of 70 \\u2013 75% is then obtained. 85% of the lactose in this syrup is hydrolysed and can be used as a sweetener in the baking industries and in the manufacture of ice-cream.\\n\\nDuring production the enzyme is inactivated by heat treatment or by pH.\\n```\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687187, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 439, \"prompt_tokens\": 1190, \"total_tokens\": 1629, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

Such systems with immobilised enzymes can be used for continuous lactose hydrolysis. The enzyme, which is expensive, is not consumed and can be used to hydrolyse large amounts of product. This increases the profitability. The technique has not yet been developed to any great extent.\\n\\nAcid hydrolysis\\nLactose can also be split by means of acids in conjunction with heat treatment or by passing a cation exchanger in hydrogen form at high temperature, around 100\\u00b0C. The required degree of hydrolysis is determined by selection of pH, temperature and holding time. As brown discoloration occurs during hydrolysis of the whey, active carbon treatment is recommended.\\n\\nChemical reaction\\nIt has been established that non-protein nitrogen products can be used as partial replacement for natural protein in ruminants because certain microbes in the cattle rumen can synthesize protein from urea and ammonia. However, in order to get a balanced feed of nitrogen and energy, urea and ammonia have to be transformed into more suitable forms, which slowly release nitrogen to the rumen for improved protein synthesis.\\n\\nLactosyl urea and ammonium lactate are two such products based on whey.\\n\\nLactosyl urea\\nBriefly, the procedure for production is as follows: after separation the whey is concentrated up to 75% DM, typically in two steps. After addition of urea and edible sulphuric acid the whey concentrate is held at 70\\u00b0C for 20 hours in a jacketed tank provided with agitator. Under these conditions the urea reacts with the lactose to form lactosyl urea.\\n\\nFollowing the reaction period the product is cooled and transported to a factory producing concentrated feed (pellets for instance) or directly to farmers.\\n\\nAmmonium lactate\\nThe process technique involves fermentation of the lactose in whey into lactic acid and maintaining the pH with ammonia, resulting in formation of ammonium lactate.

Weak base and weak acid ion exchangers have a restricted pH area in which they are active. Weak acid cation exchangers cannot normally be used in the low pH range, 0 \\u2013 7, because the carboxyl groups are mainly present in their free acid form as determined by their acid/base dissociation constant (often expressed as pKa = \\u201310 logarithm of the dissociation constant). At pH values higher than pKa, the carboxylic groups are in their salt form, and can consequently participate in ion exchange reactions. As a contrast, weak base anion exchange resins are only active in the low pH range, 0 \\u2013 7.\\n\\nFrom the ease-of-regeneration point of view it is beneficial to use weak resins whenever possible. They can be regenerated with acid/base respectively with an excess of only 10 \\u2013 50% of the theoretically needed amount. Strong resins require an acid/base excess of 300 \\u2013 400% compared with the theoretical value for regeneration. For demineralisation according to the classical procedure, a strong acid cation exchanger regenerated in the hydrogen form is combined with a weak base anion exchanger working in the free base (hydroxyl) form. It is not possible to use a weak acid cation exchanger instead of a strong one, because of the very advantageous equilibrium for exchange of cations for the hydrogen bound to the hydroxyl groups.\\n\\nOther important characteristics of ion exchangers, which are often discussed, are:\\n- Ion exchange capacity\\n- Swelling properties\\n- Mechanical strength\\n- Fluidisation during backflushing of the bed\\n- Pressure drop\\n- Flow-velocity restrictions\\n- Water rinse requirements after regeneration\\n\\n# Ion exchange processes for demineralisation\\n\\nDemineralisation by ion exchange has long been an established process for water treatment but has also been adopted during the past two decades for \\\"de-ashing\\\" of whey. Whey is not a uniform product as to composition. Whey from an acid casein/cheese curd has a pH of 4.3 \\u2013 4.6, while the pH of sweet whey is 6.3 \\u2013 6.6. The main difference between these two types of whey, apart from the acidifying medium, is the high level of calcium phosphate in the acid whey. It is good practice to use the cations as the basis for calculating the salt load in whey because the anions, e.g. citrates and phosphates, are involved in proteolytic reactions. This complicates the calculation of specific ion contents. The figures for cation content are typical of sweet and acid whey respectively and are shown in table 15.6.\\n\\nWhey can consequently be characterised as a liquid with a high salt load which, as a consequence, results in short cycles when ion exchange is\\n```\\n\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687183, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 768, \"prompt_tokens\": 1190, \"total_tokens\": 1958, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

It also means a high consumption of regeneration chemicals and a high salt load in the waste from both ash removal and the required surplus of regeneration chemicals. Rinse-water consumption is also high, especially for washing out excess sodium hydroxide from the weak anion resin.\\n\\nLosses of whey proteins occur on the columns due to denaturation/absorption. This is caused by great pH variation in the whey during the ion exchange process. Consumption of regeneration chemicals accounts for 60 \\u2013 70% of the operating costs of the process. The process is primarily designed for 90% demineralisation, but any demineralisation rate can be chosen if a by-pass system is used.\\n\\n### An alternative ion exchange process\\n\\nIn order to reduce consumption of regeneration chemicals and thus also create a better waste situation for a demineralisation plant, the R & D department of the Swedish Dairies Association, SMR, has developed an alternative ion exchange process. In this process, the unit operations of which are illustrated in figure 15.12, the whey first enters the anion column containing a weak base resin regenerated in the bicarbonate form (HCO\\u2083\\u207b). During anion exchange the whey anions are exchanged for HCO\\u2083\\u207b ions. After this the whey enters the cation column, containing a weak acid cation exchange resin regenerated in the ammonium form (NH\\u2084\\u207a). During the passage of the whey through this column the whey cations are exchanged for NH\\u2084\\u207a ions. Thus after the process the whey salts are exchanged for ammonium bicarbonate (NH\\u2084HCO\\u2083). The reactions can be summarised in the following formulae, where NaCl is used to represent the whey salts and R represents the insoluble resin exchange site.\\n\\n- Anion exchange : R \\u2014 HCO\\u2083\\u207b + Na\\u207a + Cl\\u207b \\u2014 R \\u2014 Cl\\u207b + HCO\\u2083\\u207b  \\n- Cation exchange: R \\u2014 NH\\u2084\\u207a + HCO\\u2083\\u207b \\u2014 R \\u2014 Na\\u207a + HCO\\u2083\\u207b\\n\\nNH\\u2084HCO\\u2083 is a thermolytic salt which decomposes to NH\\u2083, CO\\u2082 and H\\u2082O when heated. It is then volatilised during the subsequent evaporation of the whey, offering the possibility of recovering the NH\\u2083 and CO\\u2082 stripped off the whey to make up a new regeneration solution (NH\\u2084HCO\\u2083). Part of the spent regeneration solution containing excess NH\\u2084HCO\\u2083 is collected for stripping in a distillation tower (about 100% excess NH\\u2084HCO\\u2083 is used).\\n\\nFigure 15.13 shows the layout of a full-scale SMR process. The whey is first routed to the anion exchange column in HCO\\u2083 form and then to the cation exchange column in NH\\u2084 form. The ion exchange systems are paired, one working while the other is being regenerated. The cycle time is four hours.\\n\\nAfter passing the ion exchange unit (1) the cooled whey is used for heat recovery in the absorption column and as cooling medium in the condenser (2) connected to the distillation tower (9). Then the whey enters the evaporator (3) and finally the demineralised whey concentrate is spray dried (10). The condensate from evaporator stage 2, which is especially rich in ammonia, is separated from the other condensates and continues to the absorption tower (4) where it forms the liquid base for the new regeneration solution. The condensates from evaporator stages 1 and 2 are used for cleaning the ion exchange resins. The ammonia is thus recovered to a great extent. Most of the carbon dioxide stripped off during evaporation is recovered in gaseous form in the exhaust gases from the mechanical vacuum pump of the evaporator. This gas flows directly into the bottom of the absorption column, where it is completely absorbed together with other inlet streams to form NH\\u2084HCO\\u2083. Recovery is not total, so the absorption tower is fitted with lines for injection of fresh 25% NH\\u2083 solution and CO\\u2082.\\n```\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687185, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 966, \"prompt_tokens\": 1190, \"total_tokens\": 2156, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

Flow rates, temperatures, conductivity, pH of process water and product, product inlet pressure, pressure difference between the stacks and current, as well as voltage over each membrane stack, are monitored and controlled during production.\\n\\n## Limiting factors in electrodialysis\\nA major limiting factor for using electrodialysis in dairy processing is the cost of replacing membranes, spacers and electrodes, which constitute 35 \\u2013 40% of the total running costs in the plant. Replacement is necessary due to fouling of the membranes, which in turn is caused by:\\n- Precipitation of calcium phosphate on the cation exchange membrane surfaces\\n- Deposition of protein on the anion exchange membranes surfaces\\n\\nThe first problem can be handled by proper flow design over the membrane surface and regular acid cleaning.\\n\\nProtein deposits are the main factor in shortening the lifetime of the anion membranes. The background to this problem is as follows: at the normal pH of whey, the whey proteins can be regarded as large negative ions (anions) and move as such under the influence of the electrical field in the stack. These molecules, being too large to pass through the anion exchange membranes, are deposited as a thin protein layer on the faces of the anion exchange membranes in the whey compartments. Techniques such as polarity reversal can be used to dislodge these deposited materials from the membrane.\\n\\nAlthough frequent high-pH cleaning removes most of the deposits, disassembly of the stack for manual cleaning is recommended at intervals of 2 \\u2013 4 weeks.\\n\\nThe processing cost of electrodialysis depends very much on the demineralisation rate. Increasing the capacity in steps from 50% to 75% to 90% doubles the processing cost per step. This means that it is four times as expensive per kilo of product solids to demineralise to 90% than to 50%; the reason is that plant capacity is reduced at 90% demineralisation.\\n\\nWater treatment, electric power, chemicals and steam account for the operating costs of a demineralisation plant. Waste water treatment is a particularly heavy item. During production lactose leaks through the membranes at a rate of 7 \\u2013 10% at 90% demineralisation. The phosphate removed from whey also accumulates in the waste stream. The cost of electric power amounts to 10 \\u2013 15% of the processing cost, while the chemicals used in the process, mainly hydrochloric acid, account for less than 5%. The cost of steam used for preheating the product and cooling costs for control of process temperature are 10 \\u2013 15%, depending on the demineralisation level.\\n\\nElectrodialysis is best for demineralisation levels below 70%, where it is very competitive compared to ion exchange.\\n\\n## Ion exchange\\nIn contrast to electrodialysis, the process which removes ionisable solids from solutions on a continuous electro-chemical basis, an ion exchange process employs resin beads to adsorb minerals from solution, in exchange for other ionic species. The resins have a finite capacity for this, so that when they are completely saturated, the adsorbed minerals must be removed and the resins regenerated before reuse. Normally this requires the use in fixed columns of suitable design.\\n\\nIon exchange resins are macromolecular porous plastic materials, formed into beads with diameters in the range of 0.3 to 1.2 mm for technical applications. Chemically they act as insoluble acids or bases which, when converted into salts, remain insoluble. The main characteristic of ion exchange resins is their capacity to exchange the mobile ions they contain for ions of the same charge sign, contained in the solution to be treated.

One approach is based on using pretreatment followed by enzymatic hydrolysis to deconstruct the major plant carbohydrates, cellulose and hemicellulose, into monomeric sugars. These biomass-derived sugars are then clarified using solid-liquid separation processes prior to being concentrated and converted to products. Submerged aerobic fermentation production of intracellular lipids from biomass-derived sugars using oleaginous yeast is one of several sugar upgrading conversion routes being considered. Once recovered, the lipids can then be hydro-treated and isomerized to produce a hydrocarbon biofuel (1).\\n\\nNREL is developing an advanced aerobic bubble column model using Aspen Custom Modeler (ACM). The objective of this work is to integrate the new fermentor model with existing techno-economic models in Aspen Plus and Excel to establish a new methodology for guiding process design. To assist this effort, NREL has contracted Genomatica to critique and make recommendations for improving NREL\\u2019s bioreactor model and large scale aerobic bioreactor design for biologically producing lipids at commercial scale.\\n```\\n\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687214, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 251, \"prompt_tokens\": 909, \"total_tokens\": 1160, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

The objective of this work is to integrate the new fermentor model with existing techno-economic models in Aspen Plus and Excel to establish a new methodology for guiding process design. To assist this effort, NREL has contracted Genomatica to critique and make recommendations for improving NREL\\u2019s bioreactor model and large scale aerobic bioreactor design for biologically producing lipids at commercial scale.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging the great work NREL has done to this point in developing a bioreactor model, Genomatica has highlighted a few areas for improving the functionality and effectiveness of the model. Genomatica recommends using a compartment model approach with an integrated black-box kinetic model of the production microbe. We also suggest including calculations for stirred tank reactors to extend the model\\u2019s functionality and adaptability for future process designs.\\n\\nGenomatica also suggests making several modifications to NREL\\u2019s large scale lipid production process design. The recommended process modifications are based on Genomatica\\u2019s internal techno-economic assessment experience and are focused primarily on minimizing capital and operating costs (critical for fuel product commercial viability, see Table 1 on page 6). These recommendations include selecting/engineering a thermotolerant yeast strain with lipid excretion; using bubble column fermentors; increasing the volume of production fermentors; reducing the number of vessels; employing semi-continuous operation; and recycling cell mass and glycerol.\\n```\\n\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687214, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 303, \"prompt_tokens\": 909, \"total_tokens\": 1212, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

See the Bioreactor Scale section (page 15) for more details. Klaas van't Riet's and Johannes Tramper's Basic Bioreactor Design provides a detailed example (chapter 18, example 18.1) on how to set up a compartment model for bubble column reactors (3). Klaas van\\u2019t Riet\\u2019s and Rob van der Laans\\u2019 \\u201cMixing in bioreactor vessels\\u201d provides useful information on broth mixing and compartmentalization in bubble column and stirred tank reactors (4).\\n\\nIn order to maximize the effectiveness of the compartment model, a black-box kinetic model of the production microbe should also be incorporated. Linking the kinetics of the host microbe\\u2019s metabolism to the bioreactor model provides important insight into how the design (volume, geometry) impacts the environment (pH, temperature, pressure, pO2, pCO2, substrate concentration, etc.) the microbe experiences in different zones of the fermentor. The black box model can be used to calculate characteristic times for important process parameters, such as substrate, product, pH, temperature, O2, CO2, ammonium, byproducts, etc. These characteristic times can then be compared with mixing time estimates to assess the degree of broth heterogeneity for each parameter.\\n\\nFor example, substrate consumption rate and mixing time can be used to calculate the gradient in residual substrate concentration from the top (near the substrate addition point) to the bottom of the fermentor. If the microbe is sensitive to gradients in residual substrate concentration then the bioreactor volume, geometry, or number of substrate feed points may need to be adjusted to maximize process performance. Similarly, rates of O2 consumption and CO2 production can be used to calculate axial gradients in transfer rates and dissolved concentrations of O2 and CO2, respectively. Sensitivity to these parameters may also be addressed by modifying the bioreactor design (e.g., volume, aspect ratio), or by adjusting process parameters (e.g., aeration rate).\\n\\nNREL\\u2019s current model assumes a fully aerobic fermentation process with nitrogen (ammonium) limitation used as a lever to limit cell mass propagation and turn on TAG production. A simple black box model can be developed using the process reactions outlined in NREL\\u2019s statement of work (1). Because ammonium is the limiting nutrient, a relation between specific growth rate (\\u03bc) and residual ammonium concentration is required. For this the Monod growth equation for microbes can be used (5):\\n\\nEquation 1: \\u03bc = \\u03bcmax * ( S / Ks + S )\\n\\nWhere \\u03bc is the microbe specific growth rate (hr-1), \\u03bcmax is the maximum microbe specific growth rate (hr-1), S is the concentration of the limiting nutrient (ammonium), and Ks is the half-velocity constant (value of S where \\u03bc = 0.5*\\u03bcmax).\\n\\nAdditionally, a relation for specific product formation rate (qp) as a function of \\u03bc is required. The qp(\\u03bc) relation can be easily determined from experimental data. If experimental data are not available, then assumptions must be made based on the anticipated relationship between \\u03bc and qp and the kinetics of product formation (qp,max). For an aerobic process producing a product that costs energy (i.e., the biosynthetic pathway has a net consumption of biochemical energy and thus a positive change in free energy), it is difficult to predict the algebraic form of the qp(\\u03bc)\\n\\nThis report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications.\\n```\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687214, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 759, \"prompt_tokens\": 909, \"total_tokens\": 1668, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

See Figure 1 below for example plots of the qp(\\u03bc) functions outlined above in Equations 2-4. Because it is assumed that ammonium limitation is being used to downregulate growth and upregulate TAG production, Equations 3 and 4 provide more realistic functions for NREL\\u2019s black box model. Equation 3 should be used if peak specific TAG production occurs at true ammonium limitation when growth stops (\\u03bc = 0). If, however, peak specific TAG production occurs at some low level of residual ammonium and growth, then Equation 4 should be used. This would be the case if true ammonium limitation completely shuts down metabolism (growth, production, and substrate uptake). Note that maintaining a uniformly low residual ammonium concentration to maintain minimal growth and peak TAG production will likely prove difficult at scale, as gradients in residual ammonium concentration will exist at low concentration in any large fermentor.\\n\\nExample qp(\\u03bc) Relations\\n\\n![Example qp(\\u03bc) functions that can be used to fit experimental fermentation data](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy20osti/76970/fig1.png)\\n\\nFigure 1: Example qp(\\u03bc) functions that can be used to fit experimental fermentation data\\n\\nThe stoichiometric coefficients of the individual process reactions for growth, product formation, and maintenance can be used to define Herbert-Pirt distribution relations for all other process reaction components (substrate, O2, CO2, H2O, ammonium, heat) as a function of \\u03bc, qp, and maintenance coefficient (ms, g substrate/g dcw/hr). Specific rates for these components can then be calculated as a function of \\u03bc by combining the Herbert-Pirt relations with the qp(\\u03bc) relation. All component rates can then be linked to the residual ammonium concentration using the \\u03bc(S) function (6).\\n```\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687218, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 504, \"prompt_tokens\": 909, \"total_tokens\": 1413, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

The fermentation model in ACM is used to dynamically simulate a single batch from inoculation to harvest. The time-dependent results from the fermentation simulation are subsequently exported to Excel for integration and calculation of steady-state rates, which are then imported into techno-economic models in Aspen Plus (2). Genomatica has employed a similar methodology in which multiple software platforms (e.g. Mathematica, Excel, Aspen) are used to assess both steady state and dynamic processes. When modeling complete processes using multiple software platforms, Genomatica prefers to use an Excel interface with all other programs accessed on the back end, as Excel improves the accessibility of the model; i.e., most users are familiar with and comfortable using Excel.\\n\\nGenomatica\\u2019s dynamic fermentation model is set up in Mathematica and functions as a stand-alone program with a user interface that lets users easily manipulate model inputs (e.g., fermentor volume and dimensions, mixing design, process parameters, strain, etc.). The program also features a plotting tool that allows users to visualize all parameters calculated in the model without having to export the data to other software platforms. Additionally, the program allows for direct comparison of multiple simulations, which lets users assess the impact of changes in various design or process parameters on process performance. The ability to export data to other models or function as a stand-alone application improves the flexibility and effectiveness of the model. This enables the model to be used for various applications throughout all stages of a project. Genomatica\\u2019s fermentation model has been used as a tool for large-scale bioreactor design, techno-economic assessment, and design of bioreactor scale-down experiments. Genomatica recommends building process modeling tools with flexibility and user-friendliness in mind to ensure the models are leveraged at every stage of the project. Flexibility will also facilitate adaptation of the model for future process designs.\\n\\nOne important distinction between Genomatica\\u2019s and NREL\\u2019s fermentation modeling methodologies is Genomatica uses a compartment model approach. Rather than modeling the fermentation broth as a single component, Genomatica\\u2019s model compartmentalizes the broth based on assumed mixing patterns for bubble columns (based on L/D) and stirred tank reactors (based on impeller type and location). Gas and liquid phase component balances for O2 and CO2 are solved for each compartment simultaneously and iteratively using an ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver built in to Mathematica. Genomatica uses the same component balances and literature correlations for mass transfer coefficients, mass transfer rates, and gas hold-up reported for NREL\\u2019s model (2). However, it is important to note that many of these literature correlations have correction factors for temperature, pressure, and/or viscosity, which can have a significant impact on the calculations. The impact of these operating parameters is highlighted in the Bioreactor Type section below (see page 12). It is also important to note that literature correlations should be cautiously applied, as >95% of these correlations are developed in lab scale or small pilot fermentors.\\n\\nThe advantage of using a compartment model is it provides insight into how fermentor volume and geometry impact axial gradients that the microbe will encounter at scale. Not only does this\\n```\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687214, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 675, \"prompt_tokens\": 909, \"total_tokens\": 1584, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

Additionally, Biotechnology Studies Delft Leiden offers an annual Advanced Course Bioprocess Design that covers bioprocess reactions, stoichiometry, and black-box modeling with several useful and relevant examples included in the course work. The course also covers a number of other topics directly relevant to NREL\\u2019s modeling work, including mass and heat transfer, mixing in large-scale bioreactor vessels, and scale-up/scale-down approaches (23). Genomatica highly recommends attending this course, which is held annually in April, either at TU Delft or Wageningen University (12).\\n\\nModel Assumptions\\n\\nNREL's model currently assumes a theoretical maximum lipid yield of 0.33 g TAG/g glucose. It should be noted that the lipid yield (g TAG/g sugar) is very much dependent on the metabolic properties of the type of yeast used; the metabolic pathways for NADH, NADPH, and acetyl-CoA generation; their location in the cell (cytoplasm vs. mitochondria); and the type of sugar. Although there is some debate regarding the theoretical maximum yield (maximum chemical yield is 0.37 g/g), discussions with Hans Van Dijken and other literature references suggest the value is lower than the current model assumption (13). While strain engineering and alternative pathways may be employed to increase the theoretical maximum yield, Genomatica recommends performing a sensitivity analysis of yield on process economics.\\n\\nGenomatica also believes NREL should reconsider the assumption that the TAG product must be intracellular. There are significant advantages associated with an extracellular product:\\n\\n1. There is the potential to more closely approach the theoretical maximum yield when the product is excreted. This is because the ratio of product to cell mass can exceed 10, whereas for intracellular product the ratio is most probably less than 10 and even less than 5.\\n   \\n2. Product excretion would facilitate downstream product separation and eliminate the need for a cell lysis step, which would reduce both capital and operating costs. Insoluble extracellular product (lower density than water and cells) could be recovered by an inexpensive solid-liquid separation.\\n\\n3. Product excretion would enable cell mass retention, which would yield substantial cost benefits. Aseptically separating and recycling productive biocatalyst for multiple batches can have a significant impact on the effective process yield, as the average substrate consumed per cycle for generating cell mass is greatly reduced. Effective cell mass retention requires a robust production host that is genetically stable and can withstand the high shear forces encountered in the downstream separations equipment (e.g. microfiltration or centrifugation). The need for aseptic cell mass separations equipment does increase capital and operating costs compared to non-sterile systems. This cost, however, should be significantly less than the cost savings from the higher effective process yield and removal of the cell lysis process step.\\n\\n4. Product excretion will most likely also lower broth viscosity, enhancing oxygen transfer efficiency. In addition, oxygen transfer capacity will be increased due to higher oxygen solubility in the hydrocarbon phase.\\n```\\n\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687218, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 648, \"prompt_tokens\": 909, \"total_tokens\": 1557, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

Bubble column reactors are also known to provide superior performance with shear sensitive microbes, as power is distributed more evenly throughout the broth, reducing the microbe\\u2019s exposure to high shear forces (16-20).\\n\\nPerhaps the most significant advantage to employing bubble column reactors instead of stirred tank reactors is the upfront capital cost savings. Based on Genomatica\\u2019s experience with vessel fabrication vendors, stirred tank reactor costs can be anywhere from 20-30% higher than bubble columns of similar volume. Uninstalled equipment cost estimates based on vendor quotations for 660 m\\u00b3 bubble column reactors are in the $2.0-2.2 MM range, whereas stirred tank reactors are $2.5-2.7 MM. Assuming an installation factor of 2.6 and considering a facility with 50 production vessels, this equates to a total installed capital cost savings of about $67 MM and annual fixed cost savings of about $6.3 MM. The latter includes all plant labor, supervision, overhead, insurance, and taxes.\\n\\nThere are a few disadvantages of note for bubble column reactors. The most obvious disadvantage is that broth mixing is coupled with aeration, which means that the aeration rate cannot be changed without also changing the rate of broth mixing (see Figure 2 below). To maintain a constant rate of broth mixing, the level of aerobicity can be adjusted without changing the total aeration rate by manipulating the composition of the sparge air via dilution with another gas, such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide (17). However, the cost of producing pure nitrogen would likely outweigh the cost savings associated with bubble columns, and the addition of carbon dioxide to the inlet sparge gas would likely be detrimental to the performance of the production microbe. Stirred tank reactors offer more flexibility in that both agitation and aeration can be adjusted to modulate oxygen transfer rate (OTR) while maintaining a constant rate of mixing.\\n\\nOTR & Mixing Time vs. Ugs\\u00b9\\n\\n![Image](attachment)\\n\\nMixing Time vs. OTR\\u00b9\\n\\n![Image](attachment)\\n\\n1 1,000 m\\u00b3 bubble column gassed with air, vessel aspect ratio L/D = 4, broth temperature T = 35\\u00b0C, top pressure Ptop = 0.34 atm, broth viscosity \\u00b5 = 0.72 cP (H2O at 35\\u00b0C), assuming O2 depletion = 0.55%/m, Ugs used for kLa calculation, log mean concentration driving force (C*\\u2013Cl) used for OTR calculation.

Processes requiring anaerobicity or low levels of oxygenation (<15 mol/m\\u00b3/hr) would result in inadequate mixing and significant broth heterogeneity, unless an external broth recycle loop was added. There are also upper limits to the levels of oxygenation that can be achieved in bubble column reactors. The maximum achievable oxygen transfer rate is limited by the maximum operating superficial gas velocity, as liquid entrainment in the gas phase occurs with gas velocities above 0.3 m/s (17). Oxygen enrichment is another strategy that may be employed to increase oxygen transfer rates; however, the cost benefits should be carefully evaluated, including also accounting for the effects of further elevated pCO\\u2082.\\n\\nAnother important consideration is the impact of broth physical properties on mass transfer characteristics. Temperature, pressure, and viscosity have a significant impact on the maximum achievable oxygen transfer rate (see Figure 3 and Figure 4 below). Increasing broth temperature and operating pressure increase OTR capacity, while increasing broth viscosity decreases OTR capacity. These effects highlight the importance of understanding process requirements and operating ranges in order to select the proper process equipment.

Column geometry and hydrostatic pressure have a significant impact on mass transfer and broth mixing. It is important to note, however, that the industrial scale conditions can be modeled and simulated at lab scale using various methodologies, including oscillation control algorithms and multi-compartment reactor configurations. These studies are best conducted using stirred tank reactors because they provide full flexibility in mimicking aeration rate (vvm), kLa, and mixing time.\\n\\nFor the large-scale submerged aerobic cultivation of oleaginous yeast, Genomatica recommends the use of bubble column reactors for the cost savings and operational advantages outlined above, provided that broth viscosity is <2 cp at >235\\u00b0C. It is recommended that more data be collected in order to refine model assumptions and to verify bubble columns are sufficient for the anticipated process requirements. It is particularly important to generate broth viscosity data for high cell density oleaginous yeast, recognizing that viscosity is also impacted by fermentation temperature. Considering the impact current assumptions have on reactor design, both reactor types should be included in the model. This flexibility will allow NREL to leverage the modeling capabilities developed during this assignment for future projects, as stirred tanks might prove beneficial for other process designs (e.g., fermentation processes with OTR <15 mol/m\\u00b3/hr or >150 mol/m\\u00b3/hr). The addition of stirred tank reactors to the current model should be easily accomplished with the addition of a few literature correlations for mass transfer and mixing (see references 3-4 for more details).\\n\\n# Bioreactor Scale\\n\\nNREL's current process design assumes a maximum vessel volume of 500 m\\u00b3 for an aerobic process.

For example, a thermotolerant yeast can dramatically increase the efficiency of bioreactor cooling, reducing associated costs (see also Bioreactor Cooling, pp16-18). On this specific point, a modification that increases yeast thermotolerance has been discovered recently; see Caspeta et al. (14). Sensitivities to carbon dioxide levels and oxygen gradients can influence the choice of fermentor aspect ratios and the practical limitations of the fermentor volume. Selecting a strain that has demonstrated robust performance under these conditions will allow for larger fermentors and realization of the associated cost advantages. Genetic stability is another important consideration as more generations of cell mass propagation are required at scale. This aspect is even more important if enhanced modes of fermentor operation, such as semi-continuous or continuous production, are employed due to the associated increased tendencies for genetic degeneration in extended cultivation.\\n\\nThe ability to utilize glycerol as a fermentation substrate should also be considered. Glycerol is a byproduct of the chemical process used to convert TAGs to usable biodiesel fuel. This represents a significant cost savings opportunity for the process, as the hydrocarbon fuel yield could be increased by ~5%. Otherwise, there will be a large volume of glycerol to dispose as waste, adding to the fuel production cost.\\n\\nAnother important consideration for strain selection is the potential to capture value from spent cells as a co-product. By selling the cell mass as a co-product, production costs can be substantially decreased. Solazyme, for example, is currently seeking regulatory approval for applications of a co-product cell mass in animal feed. More information on the use of genetically modified microbes in animal feed can be obtained from the Association of American Feed Control Officials (15).

Bubble column reactors have excellent heat and mass transfer characteristics, making them suitable for a wide range of process conditions. Additionally, the design simplicity and lack of moving parts in bubble columns greatly reduces the capital, operating, and maintenance costs associated with more complex stirred tank reactors. The mechanical simplicity and lack of agitator shaft and impellers also improves vessel cleanability and sterilizability, which reduces the risk of contamination and greatly improves process.\\n```\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687219, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 573, \"prompt_tokens\": 909, \"total_tokens\": 1482, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

Furthermore, the model can be used to design process scale-down experiments to proactively evaluate process performance and de-risk the scale-up process. Any performance issues identified through scale-down experimentation can then be addressed via process or strain engineering ahead of commercialization, even after the commercial design has been locked in (23).\\n\\n# Bioreactor Cooling Design\\n\\nReactor cooling methodology is an important design consideration that is tied to process oxygenation requirements and fermentor scale and geometry. The metabolic heat released during aerobic fermentation is a function of oxygen consumption, as the catabolism of sugars by microbes is exothermic. Heat removal capacity is a function of heat transfer coefficient, heat transfer area, cooling fluid flow rate, and temperature differential between the broth and reactor coolant (delta T). Removal of excess heat is required to maintain broth temperature at the optimal set point. If heat removal is insufficient, broth temperature will rise, which may result in enzyme degradation, cell death, and significant production losses. It is important to know the rate of heat generation during fermentation, the effect of fermentation temperature on performance, and the feasible range of fermentor operating temperatures in order to employ a cooling system that provides sufficient cooling capacity.\\n\\nIt is generally accepted that the heat evolution rate during aerobic fermentation is directly proportional to the oxygen consumption rate of the microbe. The metabolic heat generated can be estimated using the following relation (3,24):\\n\\n**Equation 5:** \\\\( Q_{met} = 460 \\\\times OUR \\\\)\\n\\nWhere \\\\( Q_{met} \\\\) is the rate of metabolic heat generation in kJ/m\\u00b3/hr and OUR is the oxygen uptake rate in mol O\\u2082/m\\u00b3/hr. This linear relationship allows the heat release to be estimated based on the oxygen uptake rate profile of the production process. Heat generated via agitation (for stirred tank reactors) and heat removed via evaporative cooling due to aeration should also be considered, though often these contributions to the heat balance are negligible compared to the metabolic heat load.\\n\\nThe three most common methods for fermentor heat removal are wall cooling via vessel jacket, internal cooling via banks of coils, and external loop cooling via pumping broth through a heat exchanger. There are advantages and disadvantages to each methodology that must be considered when deciding which system(s) to employ at scale.\\n\\nJacketed wall cooling capacity is constrained by the scale and geometry of the fermentor, which impacts the surface area available for heat transfer. Increasing reactor volume typically reduces the heat removal capacity per unit volume due to reduction in the heat transfer surface area to volume ratio and/or because of the need for increased wall thickness to compensate for higher hydrostatic pressures (which reduces the heat transfer coefficient). Because of this, wall cooling typically requires larger temperature differentials between the broth and cooling medium. Larger delta T typically requires a chiller, which increases both capital and operating costs. The primary advantage of wall cooling over internal coils and external loops is that it poses no risk of\\n```\\n\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687226, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 630, \"prompt_tokens\": 909, \"total_tokens\": 1539, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

For continuous operation, fermentation broth is continuously harvested from the vessel for downstream process, while sterile media and substrate are continuously fed to the vessel to maintain a constant volume.\\n\\nOperating the fermentation process in semi-continuous or continuous mode can increase the effective reactor productivity, and these modes should be evaluated in addition to fed-batch operation. Implementing these modes of operation can have a significant impact on plant capacity or the volume and number of fermentors required to achieve target plant capacity, which ultimately impacts production costs. Secondary benefits of these operational modes include reduction in total time dedicated to vessel turnaround, reduced physical stress on equipment due to less frequent sterilization cycles, reduction in the number of seed fermentations, reduction in the number of seed vessels required, and reduction in operator involvement and operator-related errors. One could also argue the reduction in operator involvement inherently reduces the risk of contamination and improves process reliability. However, in (semi)continuous operation there is more opportunity for contamination to develop due to extended process time. In that sense, contamination events in a (semi)continuous mode can be more problematic than in short-cycle batch mode.\\n\\nAlthough the benefits of these operational modes are significant, there are some key process and design considerations that must be addressed in order for these operational modes to work effectively. For semi-continuous (fill-and-draw) and continuous operations, a separate vessel may be required for media conditioning (adjusting to target pH, temperature, and concentration) prior to charging into a fermentor with active culture. This procedure is done to avoid shocking or killing the live cells. Alternatively, media conditioning can be done in-line between the sterilizer and fermentation distribution header via injection of sterile water for dilution and base for pH adjustment, followed by a static mixer for blending. An in-line heat exchanger can be used to reduce the media temperature to the target range. In-line conditioning comes with inherent operational risks. For instance, if equipment failure or operator error results in unconditioned media deactivating live culture, then significant production delays can occur while new seed is generated. On the other hand, in-line conditioning leads to significant cost savings by eliminating the need for large aseptic day vessels.\\n\\nIn addition to process considerations, there are some key features of the production host microbe that must be considered for (semi)continuous operational modes. Due to the extended processing time, additional propagation of the production microbe is required. Therefore, the host strain must be genetically stable for the anticipated number of generations expected at scale, as any instability may result in loss of production. Genome stability can be assessed using multi-stage flask propagation followed by whole genome sequencing. For semi-continuous fill-and-draw operation, the host microbe must be robust under repeated substrate depletion cycles, as the broth must be completely depleted of substrate prior to harvest to avoid yield losses. For continuous operation, the host microbe must perform well under substrate-limited conditions, as broth is continuously withdrawn from the fermentor. Alternatively, substrate could be separated downstream and recycled back to the process; however, this mode of operation would most likely increase production costs.\\n\\nThis report is available at no cost from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at www.nrel.gov/publications.\\n```\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687232, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 680, \"prompt_tokens\": 909, \"total_tokens\": 1589, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

For slow growing production strains, this means a multi-stage seed propagation approach is likely required in which cell mass is scaled up using multiple seed fermentors in a staggered train. Staggering of seed stages allows for turnaround activities, including cleaning, sterilization, and media charging and conditioning procedures, to be conducted concurrent to seed growth. The downside of multiple seed stages is the additional capital and operating costs for extra vessels, and the inherent process risks associated with additional process steps and transfers (i.e., increased operational complexity). Consequently, a microbe selected for rapid growth during the seed stages will reduce complexity and cost by minimizing the number of seed stages and fermentors.\\n\\nOne useful operating strategy to circumvent seed limitations is to use a semi-continuous (fill-and-draw) operational mode for the seed process. Fill-and-draw operation involves removing a percentage of the inoculum at the end of the seed propagation phase for inoculation of the production reactor, while leaving behind a portion of the seed to inoculate the next seed stage (forgoing cleaning and sterilization procedures). Fresh, sterile, pre-conditioned media is aseptically added to the remaining inoculum in the seed vessel to begin the next seed stage. This seed stage, which is typically much shorter due to a higher starting cell mass concentration, is subsequently used to inoculate the next production fermentor. This mode of operation requires pre-conditioning of sterile media prior to addition to the residual inoculum in the seed vessel. Fill-and-draw operations can be repeated numerous times, allowing a single seed fermentor to inoculate multiple production fermentors using a staggered batch schedule. It is important to note that the total number of generations must be considered when implementing fill-and-draw seed operations to ensure genetic stability of the production microbe throughout the process. Laboratory experiments should be conducted to simulate the total number of generations and demonstrate sustained biocatalyst productivity for the desired number of fill-and-draw cycles.\\n\\nFill-and-draw seed operation is advantageous because it typically reduces the total number of seed fermentors required for inoculation of production fermentors, reducing capital costs. It also reduces the fraction of operational time dedicated to seed fermentor turnaround and the total number of CIP and SIP cycles, reducing operating costs and increasing cell mass production capacity. Conversely, fill-and-draw seed operations increase susceptibility to contamination due to increased system complexity and more transfer operations. There is also an increased risk of production loss in the event of a seed contamination as multiple production fermentors are inoculated from a single seed vessel.\\n\\nThe design considerations outlined above for bioreactor type and cooling methodology also apply for the design of the seed train. The primary driver for the seed reactor type and cooling methodology selections is the required oxygen transfer rate, which is driven by the target final cell mass concentration and the cell mass yield on oxygen. Broth physical properties, including temperature, pressure, and viscosity, must also be considered as these impact the heat and mass transfer calculations.\\n```\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687233, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 606, \"prompt_tokens\": 909, \"total_tokens\": 1515, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

Another advantage is that the addition of a jacket has a modest impact on equipment costs.\\n\\nInternal cooling coils provide higher heat transfer coefficients and more surface area compared to wall cooling, which increases the cooling capacity. The increase in surface area may allow for smaller temperature differentials between the broth and cooling medium and may eliminate the need for a chiller. This depends on the metabolic heat load generated by the process and also seasonal temperature variation (i.e., chilled water may only be needed in warm weather with cooling tower water being sufficient in cold weather). The major disadvantage of internal cooling coils is the increased risk of contamination, which ultimately impacts process reliability. Internal cooling coils will experience pin-hole leaks and stress fractures due to repeated expansion and contraction cycles during sterilization procedures and the corrosive effects of some fermentation media. These leaks allow non-sterile cooling medium to enter the fermentor and contaminate the broth, as the pressure inside the coil is typically higher than the pressure in the broth. The installation of coil banks inside the fermentor also impacts vessel cleanability. The coils introduce blind spots and provide crevices where contaminants may accumulate. The coil banks may also negatively impact broth mixing and mass transfer, which ultimately impacts process performance.\\n\\nExternal loop cooling can provide even higher heat transfer coefficients and more surface area than internal coils, as the size and number of external heat exchangers can be adjusted as necessary. Provided delta T is sufficient (fermentation temperature \\u2265 35\\u00b0C), this allows for cooling tower water to be used as the cooling medium and eliminates the need for a chiller, which results in capital and operating costs savings. Because external cooling loops decrease cooling capacity from reactor scale or geometry, larger vessel volumes may be used. Larger vessels also yield significant capital cost advantages. One disadvantage of external cooling loops is the addition of a centrifugal pump, heat exchanger, and extra flanged connections that pose contamination risks. The aseptic design and maintenance of the external loop equipment are an important consideration to ensure process reliability. Heat exchanger gasket materials should be carefully chosen for material compatibility and robustness. The centrifugal broth pump should have double mechanical seals that are sterilized with steam and operated with sterile steam condensate. The loop should also be designed to drain completely during CIP/SIP procedures to facilitate cleaning and sterilization. Furthermore, the operating pressure in the loop should be high enough to ensure any leaks flow out of the sterile boundary. In addition to sterility concerns, the impact of temperature differential, higher shear forces, and anoxia in the external loop on the health and performance of the production microbe must be considered. For example, exposing the cells in the loop to colder temperatures for longer residence times may result in cold shock and negatively impact strain performance. The high broth pumping rate also exposes the cells to higher shear forces, which may result in cell lysis and loss of productive cell mass. On the other hand, the high pumping rate will actually increase the oxygen mass transfer coefficient (kLa). Anoxia in the cooling loop can be avoided if sufficient gas bubbles are circulated in the broth and the loop residence time is properly managed. Failure to properly design the loop in the case of oxygen-sensitive microbes may negatively impact metabolism.\\n\\nThe use of external cooling loops will likely be necessary to achieve the lowest capital and operating costs. Considering the risks outlined above, Genomatica recommends performing lab and pilot studies to test the impact of loop conditions (temperature differential, residence time,\\n```\\n\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687230, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 701, \"prompt_tokens\": 909, \"total_tokens\": 1610, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

The scale and number of seed fermentors are determined by the scale and number of production fermentors; the target final cell mass concentration in the seed fermentor; the target starting cell mass concentration in the production fermentor; the mode of operation of the production fermentor; the mode of operation of the seed fermentor; oxygen and heat transfer limitations in the seed fermentor; the specific growth rate of the production microbe; and the cell mass yield on oxygen of the production microbe.\\n\\nFrom a production standpoint, it is advantageous to maximize the use of seed fermentor capacity and produce as much biocatalyst as possible during the time allotted for the seed fermentation phase. Front loading more cell mass into the production fermentor reduces the time required for cell mass generation during the early stages of the production fermentation, which can have a significant impact on the productivity of the process. For instance, doubling the starting cell mass concentration in the production fermentor eliminates one doubling from the early aerobic growth phase, which can shave several hours off of the production fermentation time depending on the microbe growth rate (see Figure 8 below). A higher starting cell mass concentration in the production fermentor requires a larger seed fermentor (larger volumetric transfer into production fermentor) or a higher final cell density in the seed culture (which also requires higher oxygen and heat transfer capabilities in the seed fermentor). Either way, more cell mass must be generated, requiring more seed propagation time.\\n\\n## Doubling Time vs. Growth Rate\\n![Doubling Time vs. Growth Rate](#)\\n\\n## Seed Time vs. Growth Rate\\u00b9\\n![Seed Time vs. Growth Rate](#)\\n\\n\\u00b9 Seed working volume = 80 m\\u00b3; inoculated from single flask, 20 doublings to achieve target final biomass = 16 g dcw/L.\\n\\n### Figure 8: Impact of microbe growth rate on seed fermentation time\\n\\nThe growth rate of the production microbe is an important factor that must be considered in the design of the seed train, especially if the total seed propagation time exceeds the total production fermentation time (including fermentor turnaround).

The largest installed bubble columns are also 1,000 m\\u00b3. These reactors were designed, built, and operated by Pfizer for citric acid production at their Southport, North Carolina facility (including fermentation of alkanes to citric acid by oleaginous yeast in the 1970s). The site was later purchased by ADM and is still operating today.\\n\\n**Table 2: List of Aerobic Commercial-Scale Fermentors**\\n\\n| Company          | Location                | Reactor Type     | Volume (m\\u00b3) |\\n|------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-------------|\\n| Fermic           | Lebrija, Mexico         | Stirred Tank     | 190         |\\n| Novozymes        | Ottawa, Canada          | Bubble Column     | 220         |\\n| Tate & Lyle      | Decatur, Illinois       | Bubble Column     | 227         |\\n| ADM              | Clinton, Iowa           | Stirred Tank     | 500         |\\n| Cargill          | Eddyville, Iowa         | Bubble Column     | 500         |\\n| Cargill          | Uberlandia, Brazil      | Bubble Column     | 500         |\\n| Nutraceuticals   | Augusta, Georgia        | Bubble Column     | 520         |\\n| Dupont-Tate & Lyle | Loudon, Tennessee     | Bubble Column     | 600         |\\n| Solazyme         | Moema, Brazil           | Stirred Tank     | 600         |\\n| Evonik           | Castro, Brazil          | Stirred Tank     | 700         |\\n| Jungbunzlauer    | Pernhofen, Austria      | Bubble Column     | 750         |\\n| Jungbunzlauer    | Port Colborne, Canada   | Bubble Column     | 750         |\\n| Italprotein      | Sarroch, Italy          | Stirred Tank     | 1,000       |\\n| ADM              | Southport, NC          | Bubble Column     | 1,000       |\\n\\nGenomatica\\u2019s fermentor modeling work and input from fermentor fabricators suggest that even larger vessel volumes can be employed for aerobic processes using bubble column reactors. Considering the cost implications of building larger vessels (see Figure 5 below), it is advantageous to maximize fermentor volume to within practical limits. Ultimately, the maximum volume for aerobic production reactors depends on process requirements for oxygen transfer, heat transfer, the production host\\u2019s sensitivity to scale-dependent parameters, and production scheduling considerations (i.e., <4 fed-batch fermentors imposes inefficiencies in supporting utilities). Scale-dependent parameters include hydrostatic pressure, partial pressure of dissolved gases (e.g., CO\\u2082), and broth heterogeneity (gradients in oxygen transfer rates, dissolved oxygen concentration, pH, temperature, and substrate concentration). Increasing reactor volume typically amplifies the severity of these scale-dependent parameters (see Figure 6 below), which points to the importance of selecting a robust production host (insensitive to fluctuations) for maximizing vessel volume and minimizing cost. This also highlights the need for developing detailed process models to assess the combined effects of all parameters that impact capital and operating costs. Building an integrated fermentor-microbe model, as described above, provides insight into how\\n```\\n\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687229, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 759, \"prompt_tokens\": 909, \"total_tokens\": 1668, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

Later, many other antibiotics were made via this method. Over the years, it has become a route to economically produce a variety of compounds, including enzymes, amino acids, vitamins, flavor enhancers, thickening and binding agents, and cleaning compounds. The list keeps growing. \\n\\nOne reason for its widespread use is its specificity for producing compounds \\u2014 that is, some species are difficult to make by other means, and other routes may produce high concentrations of byproducts. Another reason is that fermentation requires comparatively mild conditions, in terms of temperature, pressure and pH. This often allows for less-costly equipment and lower energy costs compared with using standard chemical synthesis. Still, few operating fermenters are designed to minimize their total operating power, which is used primarily by:\\n- the agitator, which disperses air into the broth and provides for a reasonable level of compositional uniformity, and\\n- the air-delivery system, which comprises a compressor, filter and associated piping.\\n\\n## Current practice\\n\\nMost aerobic fermenters are, in fact, designed using little data. Typically, engineers simply select equipment that has been found to be suitable for making similar products. Often, only a little or no pilot work is done. If these studies are undertaken, they are carried out to determine the ideal conditions for the organism, such as pH, temperature, and concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO). Nutrients from the feed vs. feedstock consumption may also be investigated.\\n\\nHowever, little attention is given to collecting the data needed to predict the full-scale oxygen transfer and energy consumption. To make matters worse, the pilot conditions usually differ from those in the scale-up, commercial unit. Compared with commercial equipment, pilot units operate at a much higher agitator specific power (power/unit mass or volume) and a much lower superficial gas velocity (actual gas flow divided by the tank's cross-sectional area).\\n\\nNonetheless, attempts are sometimes made to scale up from the limited pilot data. These can be based on using equal agitator power/volume, with the air flow scaled up using an equal volume of gas per volume of liquid per minute (VLM). When such a technique yields unreasonably large equipment, as it usually does, engineering judgment is employed to compensate for the increase in superficial gas velocity to preserve driving force in the full-scale equipment. However, such judgment carries some risk, since the relative contribution of agitation and air flow to mass transfer can vary considerably for different processes and different agitation systems.\\n```\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687253, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 597, \"prompt_tokens\": 909, \"total_tokens\": 1506, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

To obtain this relationship accurately, the pilot plant must be operated under the same range of conditions as will be found in the full-scale equipment. In practice, this means using much more air and much less agitation than is normal for pilot operation. To obtain the same superficial gas velocity in the pilot plant as in the production equipment, it is not unusual to need a VSM of 10\\u201315/min, whereas the full-scale VSM may be 0.5\\u20131.5/min. If the pilot facility does not have sufficient air available, then its air-delivery system must be beefed up. Otherwise, the correlations obtained will not be accurate. Data must be taken using an impeller system similar to the one that will be used in the full-scale fermenter. Although impeller system design is beyond the scope of this article, properly sized axial upper impellers combined with a lower concave radial impeller have been found to promote excellent liquid-phase DO uniformity. This arrangement has a high gas-handling ability and the difference in power draw between the ungassed and the gassed states is minimal.\\n\\n## Determining system parameters\\nThe defining equation for mass transfer in a fermenter is:  \\n\\\\[ OTR = k_La(C^{*} - C) \\\\tag{1} \\\\]\\n\\nThe goal of the pilot study is to correlate k_La, the overall mass-transfer coefficient, to the agitation and airflow conditions. The correlation is ideally done around the point in the process where oxygen demand is at a maximum, and under similar levels of agitator specific power and superficial gas velocity. This correlation is established by using a simple exponential relationship:  \\n\\\\[ k_La = a(PV)(U)_{j} \\\\tag{2} \\\\]\\n\\nThe constants a, b and c are derived by empirically fitting the experimental data to the equation. With a clean\\n\\n## Nomenclature\\n- \\\\( a, b, c \\\\) = empirical constants in Eq 2\\n- \\\\( C_{x} \\\\) = dissolved oxygen concentration, mg/L\\n- \\\\( C_{x}^{*} \\\\) = dissolved oxygen concentration at saturation, mg/L\\n- \\\\( b_{O} \\\\) = dissolved oxygen concentration, mg/L\\n- \\\\( k_L \\\\) = mass-transfer coefficient, s\\u207b\\u00b9 or hr\\u207b\\u00b9\\n- \\\\( OTR \\\\) = oxygen transfer rate, mg-h/L\\n- \\\\( P_{V} \\\\) = specific power, W/m\\u00b3\\n- \\\\( U \\\\) = superficial gas velocity, M/s\\n- \\\\( V_{M} \\\\) = volume of gas per volume of liquid per minute, min\\u207b\\u00b9\\n\\n## Full-scale degrees of freedom\\nIt is possible to get the desired OTR in the full-scale equipment in a number of different ways. At low airflow rates, the gas superficial velocity will be low, so higher agitation power is needed to compensate for this, even to get an equal mass-transfer coefficient. Low gas flow also equates to more oxygen depletion in the exit gas, resulting in a reduced concentration-driving force, which further requires more agitation. In fact, there is a theoretical minimum airflow: that at which 100% of the oxygen in the air stream is required to meet the required OTR. In such a case, impractical levels of agitation would be required since the driving force would be small at the inlet and zero at the outlet. At higher airflow rates, the driving force and gas superficial velocity both increase, resulting in less agitator power being needed to achieve the same OTR. There is a practical maximum air flow as well. The author\\u2019s experience suggests that operation at superficial gas velocities above 0.6 m/s should be avoided, so as not to allow excessive reinvestment of the process liquid in the gas stream, which can range from a theoretical minimum to practical maximum, the compressor power requirements increase with airflow, but the required agitator power simultaneously decreases. The sum of the agitator and the compressor power will, in fact, push toward a minimum. It is the goal of this article to show how to operate as close to this minimum as possible.\\n\\n## Optimizing full-scale design\\nThe following steps should produce a system design that operates close to the minimum power requirement.\\n1. Based on the peak OTR, calculate the minimum air flow required at 100% utilization.\\n2. Choose an air flow that is greater than the theoretical minimum calculated in Step 1 for the first design calculation. Start out at about 20% above the minimum.\\n3. Perform a mass balance and determine the exit gas flow rate and composition, including the amount of \\\\( CO_{2} \\\\) required.\\n4. Calculate the driving force for mass transfer. For full-scale equipment, use a log-mean driving force, rather than the simple form given in Eq. 1. Accurate saturation data are needed.\\n```\\n\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687253, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_81274e7ad2\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 1041, \"prompt_tokens\": 909, \"total_tokens\": 1950, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

It can also be used in an existing fermenter to compute the optimum conditions during the batch cycle, which, of course, has a varying oxygen demand from beginning to end. If the agitator and agitator speed are both variable, then a control-logic sequence can be developed to minimize energy usage throughout the processing sequence.\\n\\nThis procedure may seem to involve a lot of calculation time. Of course, once the system equations have been defined, they can be put into a computerized spreadsheet so repeated calculations will take little time. The potential reward can be significant. It is not unusual for a 150,000-L fermenter to operate at 100 kW or more away from the optimum condition. Assuming a typical plant has 10 such fermenters and the units run at full speed 50% of the year, the annual savings potential is about $350,000 at an electric power cost of $0.08/kWh. For designing a new system, such a determination will result in much lower capital costs, as well.\\n\\n## Example\\n\\nThe figure on the right shows how the power consumption varies when this procedure is used. A simplifying assumption of constant gas pressure drop was made, as appropriate for new construction. The figure shows the compressor power, agitator power and total power as a function of air flow. Note that the beginning air flow used is close to the theoretical minimum, so the agitator power is rather high. There is a fairly broad band in which the required power is roughly constant. As long as the fermenter is designed in this range, it will be close to optimum. If an agitator impeller system is chosen that has most constant gassed power characteristics, then the agitator installed power can be fixed and airflow can be adjusted to the minimum that will provide the necessary DO level. This will allow for sufficient operating flexibility while keeping the capital and operating costs to a minimum. If the impeller system has a power draw that is sensitive to airflow, it may be necessary to use a variable-speed drive on the agitator to achieve the desired result.\\n\\n## Sample Problem\\n\\nSuppose a production fermenter has a diameter of 3.66 m, a liquid volume of 114 m\\u00b3, and an ungasified liquid height of 10.97 m. The broth has an unreacted specific gravity of 1.0. The temperature is 38\\u00b0C. At 1 atm, the saturation value of DO is 7.0 mg/L, based on air that is not enriched with oxygen. When oxygen is fed into the broth, 95% of it is returned as respired carbon dioxide. The consumption rate or OTR is 2,000 gmol/h. Minimum desired oxygen concentration in the broth is 2 mg/L. The fermenter will be operated at a gauge backpressure of 0.683 atm. Line losses from the sparger to the vessel will be 2.04 atm. Assume a 95% mechanical efficiency for the agitator and 70% for the compressor. The step-by-step optimization procedure is as follows:\\n\\n**Step 1.** Total OTR required is 2,000 mL/h x 114,000 L = 228 x 10\\u2076 mg/O\\u2082/h = 1,125 mg/mol. One at normal conditions (0\\u00b0C and 1 atm) contains 44.6 g/mol. Air at 21\\u00b0C, O\\u2082 contains 9.366 g of O\\u2082/M\\u00b3, so the air flowrate is 15,729.5/9.366 = 760.7 m\\u00b3/h, or 12.68 m\\u00b3/min.\\n\\nFigure. To optimize power consumption, the fermenter must be designed in the range where power consumption is roughly constant. In this example, the power consumption is relatively constant for a broad range.\\n```\", \"refusal\": null, \"role\": \"assistant\", \"audio\": null, \"function_call\": null, \"tool_calls\": null}}], \"created\": 1737687253, \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"service_tier\": \"default\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_bd83329f63\", \"usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 1122, \"prompt_tokens\": 909, \"total_tokens\": 2031, \"completion_tokens_details\": {\"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0, \"audio_tokens\": 0, \"reasoning_tokens\": 0, \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0}, \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\"audio_tokens\": 0, \"cached_tokens\": 0}}}\n",

Normally, the iteration process would start with 20% higher airflow than the above value, but for illustration purposes, only one iteration is needed. Therefore, the flow rate above value is used (vs. 1.20 times the flowrate), which is 25 M\\u00b3/min. \\n\\nStep 3. Perform the mass balance. The inlet airflow for 25 M\\u00b3/min contains a total of 1,115 gmol/s, of which 234.2 are O\\u2082, and the balance, 880.8 gmol, is other gases; which will be carried through the fermenter unchanged, 7.15 gmol/h, or 118.8 gmol/h O\\u2082 consumed, leaving 115.4 gmol/min of O\\u2082 in the outlet gas. In addition, CO\\u2082 is generated at the rate of 112.8 gmol/min (95% of the value of oxygen consumed). So, the outlet gas rate is 1,109 gmol/min with 10.4% CO\\u2082. This corresponds to a gas flow at the outlet of 24.9 M\\u00b3/min. \\n\\nStep 4. To calculate the driving force, we need to know the absolute pressure and concentration of the air stream at the top and bottom, as well as the DO concentration in the broth at the top and bottom. The bottom pressure equals the backpressure plus liquid head: 0.68 atm + 1 atm (gage pressure) + 1.06 atm (1097 kg liquid head at 1.0 S.G.) = 2.74 atm abs. Since the saturation value at 1 atm and 21% O\\u2082 is mg/L, the saturation concentration at the outlet of the fermenter is Y = 2.74, or 19.18 mg/L.\\n\\nThe pressure at the top is 1.68 atm (abs.), and the concentration of O\\u2082 is 10.46%, so saturation concentration is mg/L x 1.68 x (10.421) = 58.27 mg/L. Now that saturation values have been established, calculate the driving force. To this, the liquid DO concentrations must be known. It has been established that a minimum of 2 mg/L is needed for the fermenter to work effectively. However, since fermenters are not perfectly mixed, there will be a concentration gradient.\\n\\nThe author has seen cases using multiple mini-pellers where DO varied from bottom to top by more than an order of magnitude. Therefore, for a combination of axial and radial impellers used in fermenters of this size, the DO at the bottom will be about 50% higher than at the top. Using this basis, assigning a value of 2 mg/L at the top and 3 mg/L at the bottom. The log-mean driving force is equal to [(58.27 - 19.81)/(ln(58.27/19.31)) = 8.56 mg/L.\\n\\nStep 5. The required kLa = OTR/driving force = (2,000 mg/L)/(8.56 mg/L) = 233.67 h\\u207b\\u00b9 or 0.06495.\\n\\nStep 6. The average molar flow of gas at the middle is (1,115 + 1,109) / 2 = 1,112 mg/min, or 24.93 M\\u00b3/min. The absolute pressure at the midpoint equals the backpressure plus one-half of the liquid head, or 0.68 + 1 * 0.53 = 2.21 atm. The temperature is 293 K or 31.1 K. Based on ideal gas law adjustments, the actual gas flow is 24.93 x (1/2.213) = 12.85 M\\u00b3/min.\\n\\nStep 7. Based on the tank diameter of 3.66 m, the superficial gas velocity is 0.2004 M/s.\\n\\nStep 8. For this example, it is assumed that the constants a, b and c in Eq. 2 are 0.02, 0.6, and 0.6, respectively, based on units of 1/h for kL, kA, W/m\\u00b2 for PV and M/S for U. Ideally, such constants should be derived from experimental data taken in the actual broth and impeller system that will be used. Based on a required kLa of 0.06495 and a superficial gas velocity of 0.2004 M/s, the required agitator P/V = 349 W/m\\u00b3. For a batch size of 114 m\\u00b3, this gives a total invested power of 39.8 kW. Allowing for 95% power transmission efficiency through the gear drive and seal, the motor power draw required is about 41.9 kW. If this figure seems low, it is because the required OTR for this problem is low; this is an \\\"easy\\\" fermentation.\\n\\nStep 9. To calculate the compressor power, the inlet airflow and pressure are read, as well as the outlet compressor power, assuming roughly adiabatic operation. More detailed calculations can be made after the final statement is chosen. Adjusting for units of work for power, atm for pressure and airflow in M\\u00b3/min, and using a specific heat ratio for air of 1.394, the required compressor power is 57.97 x (k/inlet flow) x (pressure ratio)\\u00b2\\u2078\\u207b\\u00b9.\\n\\nThe inlet pressure is atm. The air inlet is adjusted to 20\\u00b0C (293 K) is 26.83 M\\u00b3/min. The outlet pressure is the back pressure plus the liquid pressure in the losses, or 1 + 0.68 + (0.5) = 2.04 + 4.78 atm. Thus, the pressure ratio is also 4.78. The compressor power is 57.97 x 26.83 x ( (4.78)\\u00b2) = 89.2 kW. Allowing for 70% efficiency, the motor power drawn is 127.4 kW. \\n\\nStep 10. The total power of the agitators that comprises compressor is 41.9 + 127.4 = 169.3 kW.\\n\\nStep 11. The optimization steps will not be repeated here, but by varying the air flow, the point of minimum power can be found, as shown in the figure on the previous page.\\n\\nCEP\\nMay 2003 www.cpegmagazine.org\\n35\\n\\nLiterature Cited\\n1.
