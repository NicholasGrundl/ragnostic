# Executive Summary  
  
NREL is developing an advanced aerobic bubble column model using Aspen Custom Modeler (ACM). The objective of this work is to integrate the bench-top fermentor model with existing techno-economic models in Aspen Plus and Excel to establish a new methodology for guiding process design. To assist this effort, NREL has contracted Genomatica to critique and make recommendations for improving NREL's bioreactor model and large scale aerobic bioreactor design for biologically producing lipids at commercial scale.  
  
While acknowledging the great work NREL has done to this point in developing a bioreactor model, Genomatica has highlighted a few areas for improving the functionality and effectiveness of the model. Genomatica recommends using a compartment model approach with an integrated black-box kinetic model of the production microbe. We also suggest including calculations for stirred tank reactors to extend the model's functionality and adaptability for future process designs.  
  
Genomatica also suggests making several modifications to NREL's large scale lipid production process design. The recommended process modifications are based on Genomatica's internal techno-economic assessment experience and are focused primarily on minimizing capital and operating costs (critical for fuel product commercial viability, see Table 1 on page 6). These recommendations include: selecting/engineering a thermotolerant yeast strain with lipid excretion; using bubble column fermentors; increasing the volume of production fermentors; reducing the number of vessels; employing semi-continuous operation; and recycling cell mass and glycerol.
