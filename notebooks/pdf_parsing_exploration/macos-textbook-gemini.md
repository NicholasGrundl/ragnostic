## Whey processing  
  
Whey, the liquid residue of cheese and casein production, is one of the biggest reservoirs of food protein still remaining largely outside human consumption channels. World whey output, at approximately 120 million tonnes in 1990, contains some 0.7 million tonnes of relatively high-value protein, equal to the protein contents of almost 2 million tonnes of soya beans. Yet, despite the chronic protein shortage in large parts of the world, a very considerable proportion of the total whey output is still wasted - the proportion of wastage was roughly 50% in 1989-1990.  
  
Whey comprises 80-90% of the total volume of milk entering the process and contains about 50% of the nutrients in the original milk: soluble

Fat is recovered in centrifugal separators.  
The fines are often pressed in the same way as cheese, after which they can be used in processed cheese and, after a period of ripening, also in cooking.  
The whey cream, often with a fat content of 25–30%, can be re-used in cheesemaking to standardise the cheese milk; this enables a corresponding quantity of fresh cream to be utilised for special cream products.  
  
## Cooling and pasteurisation  
  
Whey which is to be stored before processing must either be chilled or pasteurised as soon as the fat has been removed. For short-time storage, 10–15 hours, cooling is usually sufficient to reduce bacterial activity. Longer periods of storage require pasteurisation of the whey.  
  
## Concentration of total solids  
  
### Concentration  
  
Whey concentration traditionally takes place under vacuum in a falling-film evaporator with two or more stages. Evaporators with up to seven stages have been used since the mid-seventies to compensate for increasing energy costs. Mechanical and thermal vapour compression have been introduced in most evaporators to reduce evaporation costs still further.  
RO (reverse osmosis) plants of tubular design have also been installed in many plants for preconcentration before the whey is sent back to the farmers and before being evaporated to final concentration.  
After evaporation to 45–65% total solids, the concentrate is cooled rapidly to about 30°C in a plate heat exchanger and transferred to a triple-jacketed tank for further cooling to 15–20°C accompanied by constant stirring. This may continue for 6–8 hours to obtain the smallest possible crystals, which will give a non-hygroscopic product when spray dried.  
Concentrated whey is a supersaturated lactose solution and, under certain conditions of temperature and concentration, the lactose can sometimes crystallise before the whey leaves the evaporator. At concentrations above a DM content of 65% the product can become so viscous that it no longer flows.  
For more information on RO and evaporators see chapter 6, sections 6.4 and 6.5.  
  
## Drying  
  
Basically whey is dried in the same way as milk, i.e. in drum or spray dryers, see under milk powder in chapter 17.  
The use of drum dryers involves a problem: it is difficult to scrape the layer of dried whey from the drum surface. A filler, such as wheat or rye bran, is therefore mixed into the whey before drying to make the dried product easier to scrape off.  
Spray drying of whey is at present the most widely used method of dry-

ing. Before being dried, the whey concentrate is usually treated as men-  
tioned above to form small lactose crystals, as this results in a non-hygro-  
scopic product which does not go lumpy when it absorbs moisture.  
Acid whey from cottage cheese and casein production is difficult to dry  
due to its high lactic acid content. It agglomerates and forms lumps in the  
spray dryer. Drying can be facilitated by neutralisation and additives, such  
as skimmilk and cereal products, but this type of whey is not processed  
nowadays.  
  
Fractionation of total solids  
  
Protein recovery  
  
Whey proteins were originally isolated through the use of various precipita-  
tion techniques, but nowadays membrane separation (fractionation) and  
chromatographic processes are used in addition to both precipitation and  
complexing techniques. The process that has been most extensively used  
for separation of whey proteins from whey serum is heat denaturation. The  
precipitated protein formed by this process is either insoluble or sparingly  
soluble depending on the conditions prevailing at denaturation; it is called  
heat-precipitated whey protein (HPWP).  
  
Fink and Kessler (1988) state that a maximum whey protein denaturation  
rate of 90% is possible for all denaturable fractions. Proteose peptone,  
comprising some 10% of the fraction, is considered undenaturable.  
  
Native whey proteins, as constituents of whey powders, can easily be  
produced by careful drying of whey. Because of their unfavourable compo-  
sition, they have only a limited application in foodstuffs (only some 11%  
protein and a high lactose and ash content). Isolation of native whey pro-  
teins has therefore been developed. The native whey proteins obtained by  
membrane separation or ion exchange possess good functional properties,  
as to solubility, foaming, emulsion formation and gelling.  
  
Protein recovery by UF  
  
Native protein concentrates have a very good amino acid profile with high  
proportions of available lysine and cysteine.  
  
Whey protein concentrates (WPC) are powders made by drying the  
retentates from ultrafiltration of whey. They are described in terms of their  
protein content, % protein in dry matter, ranging from 35% to 85%. To  
make a 35% protein product the liquid whey is concentrated about 6-fold to  
an approximate total dry solids content of 9%.  
  
Example: 100 kg of whey yields approximately 17 kg of retentate and  
83 kg of permeate at close to 6-fold (5.88) concentration. Table 15.3 shows  
the compositions of the feed (whey) and the resulting retentate and per-  
meate.

ash and raise the concentration of protein relative to the total dry matter.  
Diafiltration is a procedure in which water is added to the feed as filtration  
proceeds in order to wash out low molecular components which will pass  
through the membranes, basically lactose and minerals.  
Table 15.4 shows the compositions of some typical whey protein con-  
centrate (WPC) powders.  
A process line for production of dried protein using UF is shown in figure  
15.3. About 95% of the whey is collected as permeate, and protein con-  
centrations as high as 80-85% (calculated on the DM content) can be  
obtained in the dried product. For further details about UF see chapter 6.4,  
membrane filters.  
  
Defatting of whey protein concentrate (WPC)  
Defatted WPC powder containing 80-85% protein dry matter is a very  
interesting option for some applications, e.g. as a replacement for white of  
egg in whipped products such as meringues and as a valuable ingedient in  
various foods and fruit beverages.  
Treatment of the whey retentate from a UF plant in a microfiltration (MF)  
plant can reduce the fat content of 80-85% WPC powder from 7.2% to  
less than 0.4%. Microfiltration also concentrates fat globule membranes  
and most of the bacteria in the MF retentate, which is collected and dis-  
posed of separately. The defatted MF permeate is routed to a second UF  
plant for further concentration; this stage also includes diafiltration.  
As figure 15.4 shows, the whey is preheated (1) and separated (2) to  
recover as much fat as possible in the form of 25-30% cream. This cream  
can be re-used for fat standardisation of cheese milk. The separation stage  
also removes fines. After this the whey is pasteurised (1) and cooled to  
about 55-60°C before being transferred to an intermediate holding tank.  
After a hold the whey is pumped to the first UF plant (4), where it is con-  
centrated about threefold. The retentate is pumped to the MF plant (5),  
while the permeate goes to a collecting tank after regenerative cooling (1).  
The retentate from MF treatment, which contains most of the fat and  
bacteria, is collected separately, and the defatted permeate is forwarded to  
further ultrafiltration with diafiltration (6). The resulting WPC with about 20 -  
25% DM is then spray-dried to reduce the moisture content to a maximum  
of 4% before bagging.

# Recovery of denatured whey protein  
  
In general, serum protein or whey proteins cannot be precipitated by rennet or acid. It is however possible to precipitate whey proteins with acid if they are first denatured by heat. The process is divided into two stages:  
  
* Precipitation (denaturing) of the protein by a combination of heat treatment and pH adjustment,  
* Concentration of proteins by centrifugal separation.  
  
Denatured whey proteins can be mixed with cheese milk prior to renneting; they are then retained in the lattice structure formed by the casein molecules during coagulation. This discovery led to intensive efforts to find a method of precipitating and separating whey proteins as well as a technique for optimising the yield while retaining the characteristic aroma and texture of the cheese in question.

**Fig. 15.5** Recovery of denatured whey proteins.  
  
Figure 15.5 shows the Centri-Whey process line for manufacture of denatured whey proteins. After pH adjustment the whey is pumped via an intermediate tank (1) to a plate heat exchanger (2) for regenerative heating. The temperature of the whey is raised to 90–95°C by direct steam injection (3) before it passes through a tubular holding section (4) with a holding time of 3–4 minutes. Acid is introduced during this stage to lower the pH. The acid is either organic or inorganic (e.g. lactic acid or edible hydrochloric acid) as stipulated.  
  
Those proteins that can be, and have been, modified by heat are precipitated within 60 seconds in a tubular holding section (4).  
  
After regenerative cooling to about 40°C the precipitated proteins are separated from the liquid phase in a solids-ejecting clarifier (6). The clarifier discharges, at intervals of about 3 minutes, the accumulated protein in the form of a 12–15% concentrate of which about 8–10% is protein. This method results in 90–95% recovery of the coagulable proteins.  
  
The addition of concentrated whey protein to cheese milk – principally in the manufacture of soft and semi-hard cheeses – causes only minor changes in the coagulating properties. The structure of the curd becomes finer and more uniform than with conventional methods. The processed whey proteins are more hydrophilic than casein. In the making of Camembert cheese, for example, an increase in yield of 12% has been reported.

Crystallisation  
  
The crystallisation cycle is determined by the following factors:  
• Crystal surface available for growth  
• Purity of the solution  
• Degree of saturation  
• Temperature  
• Viscosity  
• Agitation of the crystals in the solution  
Several of these factors are mutually related to each other, for example  
degree of saturation and viscosity.  
  
Figure 15.7 shows a production line for manufacture of lactose. The  
whey is first concentrated by evaporation to 60 – 62% DM and then transferred to crystallisation tanks (2) where seed crystals are added. Crystallisation takes place slowly according to a predetermined time/temperature  
programme. The tanks have cooling jackets and equipment for control of  
the cooling temperature. They are also fitted with special agitators.  
After crystallisation the slurry proceeds to decanter centrifuges (3) for  
separation of the crystals, which are dried (4) to a powder and following  
grinding, typically in a hammer mill, and sifting the lactose is packed (5).  
For efficient and simple separation of lactose crystals from the mother  
liquor, crystallisation must be arranged so that the crystals exceed 0.2 mm  
in size – the larger the better for separation.  
The degree of crystallisation is determined in principle by the quantity of  
β-lactose converted to the desired α-lactose form, and the cooling of the  
concentrate must therefore be carefully controlled and optimised.  
  
Lactose separation  
  
Various types of centrifuges can be used for harvesting lactose crystals.  
One is the horizontal decanter centrifuge, figure 15.8, which operates continuously and has a screw conveyor for unloading the lactose. Two machines are installed in series. The lactose from the first is reprocessed in the  
second for more efficient separation. During separation, impurities are  
washed from the lactose so that a high degree of purity is obtained. The  
residual moisture content of the lactose after the second separation stage is  
< 9% and pure lactose accounts for about 99% of the dry solids.  
  
Drying  
  
The lactose is dried after separation to a residual moisture content of 0.1 –  
0.5%, depending on the future use of the product. The temperature during  
drying should not exceed 93°C, as β-lactose is formed at higher temperatures. The drying time must also be taken into consideration. During quick
