# Document Ingestion System Technical Specification

## Overview
The document ingestion system serves as the primary entry point for all content entering the hierarchical RAG system. It provides a robust, automated pipeline for processing both Wikipedia articles and PDF documents, ensuring consistent handling of content and metadata throughout the system. The initial MVP focuses on reliable processing of a smaller document set while establishing the foundational architecture for future scaling.

## System Components

### File Monitor Service
The File Monitor Service acts as the system's watchdog, continuously monitoring designated input directories for new document arrivals. It serves as the first line of defense in the ingestion pipeline, performing initial validation and routing of incoming documents. This service ensures reliable file detection and prevents duplicate processing through careful state management and atomic operations.

- Implementation: Python watchdog library
- Monitors designated input directories for new files
- File type detection using magic numbers and extensions
- Supports PDF and text file formats
- Implements atomic file operations
- Handles duplicate detection via content hashing

#### Scaling Considerations
- Implement distributed file monitoring across multiple nodes
- Add support for cloud storage monitoring
- Enhance duplicate detection for distributed operation
- Add support for batch file processing

### Wikipedia Article Processor
The Wikipedia Article Processor handles the specialized task of retrieving and processing Wikipedia content through the official API. It manages rate limiting, content validation, and structured data extraction while maintaining compliance with Wikipedia's usage policies. The processor preserves article structure and metadata critical for downstream processing.

- Implementation: wikipediaapi package
- Features:
  * Batch article retrieval
  * Rate limiting (max 200 requests/hour)
  * Auto-retry mechanism
  * Error logging and reporting
  * Content validation
- Metadata extraction:
  * Title, URL, revision ID
  * Last modified date
  * Category information
  * Reference links
  * Section structure

#### Scaling Considerations
- Implement distributed article fetching
- Add mirror support for high-volume processing
- Enhance caching mechanisms
- Implement parallel processing for batch operations

### PDF Document Processor
The PDF Document Processor specializes in extracting structured content from PDF documents while preserving layout information and document hierarchy. It handles various PDF formats and structures, from simple text documents to complex academic papers with multiple columns and embedded figures.

- Implementation: Doculing integration
- Features:
  * Layout analysis with configurable parameters
  * Table and figure detection
  * Header/footer extraction
  * Page number tracking
  * Font and style analysis
- Metadata extraction:
  * Title, authors, publication date
  * Table of contents structure
  * Section headers
  * Page count and format details

#### Scaling Considerations
- Add distributed PDF processing capabilities
- Implement GPU acceleration for layout analysis
- Add support for batch processing
- Enhance memory management for large documents

### Document ID System
The Document ID System provides a consistent and reliable method for tracking documents and their components throughout the system. It maintains relationships between different levels of document hierarchy and enables efficient document retrieval and updates.

- UUID v4 base generation
- Prefix schema:
  * WIKI_{uuid} - Wikipedia articles
  * PDF_{uuid} - PDF documents
  * JOUR_{uuid} - Journal articles
- Maintains ID relationships:
  * Parent document to sections
  * Sections to chunks
  * Cross-document references

#### Scaling Considerations
- Implement distributed ID generation
- Add support for hierarchical ID structures
- Enhance relationship tracking for cross-document references
- Implement caching for frequently accessed IDs

### Metadata Management
The Metadata Management system maintains comprehensive tracking of document attributes and relationships. It ensures data quality and completeness while providing an audit trail of document processing and updates. The system handles both automatically extracted and manually added metadata.

- Extracts and validates:
  * Document title
  * Author information
  * Publication date
  * Source details
  * Document type
  * File size and format
  * Processing timestamp
  * Version information
- Implements schema validation
- Handles missing or partial metadata
- Maintains audit trail of changes

#### Scaling Considerations
- Implement distributed metadata storage
- Add support for advanced metadata querying
- Enhance schema validation for complex document types
- Add support for custom metadata fields

## Processing Pipeline

### 1. Input Detection
The input detection stage serves as the system's entry point, performing initial validation and preparation of incoming documents. It ensures that only valid, complete documents proceed to content extraction.

- Monitor input directory
- Identify file type
- Validate file integrity
- Generate unique ID

#### Scaling Considerations
- Add distributed input processing
- Implement priority queuing
- Add support for streaming input

### 2. Content Extraction
The content extraction stage handles the complex task of converting various document formats into a standardized internal representation while preserving document structure and relationships.

- Route to appropriate processor
- Extract raw text content
- Preserve structural information
- Generate initial metadata

#### Scaling Considerations
- Implement parallel processing
- Add support for additional document formats
- Enhance memory management for large documents

### 3. Quality Control
The quality control stage ensures that processed documents meet system requirements for content quality and metadata completeness. It prevents invalid or incomplete documents from entering the system.

- Content validation checks
- Metadata completeness check
- Error detection and logging
- Processing status tracking

#### Scaling Considerations
- Implement distributed validation
- Add support for custom validation rules
- Enhance error recovery mechanisms

### 4. Storage Preparation
The storage preparation stage formats documents and metadata for efficient storage and retrieval, ensuring consistency and accessibility throughout the system.

- Format standardization
- Metadata enrichment
- Relationship mapping
- Index preparation

#### Scaling Considerations
