# Query Pipeline Technical Specification

## Overview
The Query Pipeline system manages the flow of search queries through the hierarchical RAG system, implementing a two-stage retrieval process with section-aware reranking. It coordinates between the document summary and chunk collections to provide coherent, contextually relevant results. The MVP focuses on reliable retrieval with basic section-based result organization.

## System Components

### Query Preprocessor
The Query Preprocessor handles initial query preparation and optimization before vector search execution. It ensures queries are properly formatted and includes any necessary filtering parameters.

- Query text cleaning
  * Remove special characters
  * Normalize whitespace
  * Basic spell checking
- Filter extraction
  * Parse metadata constraints
  * Validate filter values
  * Format for ChromaDB query
- Query augmentation
  * Add standard prefixes/suffixes if needed
  * Expand common abbreviations
  * Handle special query types

#### Scaling Considerations
- Advanced query understanding
- Query intent classification
- Multi-language support
- Query optimization rules

### Document Filter Search
The Document Filter Search component manages the first stage of retrieval, identifying relevant documents based on summary embeddings and metadata.

- Search process:
  * Generate query embedding
  * Execute similarity search on doc_summaries
  * Apply metadata filters
  * Score and rank documents
- Output format:
  * Ranked document IDs
  * Relevance scores
  * Basic document metadata
  * Section listings

#### Scaling Considerations
- Distributed search coordination
- Advanced filter optimization
- Enhanced scoring methods
- Caching strategies

### Chunk Retrieval System
The Chunk Retrieval System performs focused search within filtered documents, retrieving relevant text chunks while maintaining section context.

- Retrieval process:
  * Filter by selected documents
  * Execute similarity search on chunks
  * Group by section
  * Track chunk positions
- Section tracking:
  * Section boundaries
  * Chunk sequence numbers
  * Section metadata
  * Context windows

#### Scaling Considerations
- Parallel chunk retrieval
- Enhanced context tracking
- Cross-document relations
- Dynamic chunk sizing

### Result Reranking
The Result Reranking system implements section-aware scoring and organization of search results, prioritizing coherent section coverage.

- Reranking factors:
  * Section coverage score
    - Count retrieved chunks per section
    - Calculate section completeness
    - Score based on coverage ratio
  * Chunk sequence analysis
    - Check chunk adjacency
    - Identify gaps in coverage
    - Prefer contiguous chunks
- Result grouping:
  * Group by section
  * Maintain document context
  * Track section boundaries
  * Preserve chunk order

#### Scaling Considerations
- Advanced scoring algorithms
- Machine learning reranking
- User feedback integration
- Context-aware scoring

## Processing Pipeline

### 1. Query Initialization
The Query Initialization stage prepares the search request for processing through the pipeline.

- Parse query parameters
- Validate request format
- Initialize search context
- Set up result tracking

#### Scaling Considerations
- Request queuing
- Priority handling
- Resource allocation
- Query optimization

### 2. First-Stage Retrieval
The First-Stage Retrieval process identifies candidate documents for detailed chunk search.

- Execute summary search
- Apply metadata filters
- Score documents
- Select top candidates

#### Scaling Considerations
- Parallel search execution
- Enhanced candidate selection
- Dynamic thresholding
- Result caching

### 3. Chunk Search
The Chunk Search process retrieves relevant text chunks from selected documents.

- Filter by document set
- Execute chunk search
- Group by section
- Track chunk metadata

#### Scaling Considerations
- Distributed chunk search
- Enhanced filtering
- Dynamic chunk selection
- Cross-node coordination

### 4. Result Organization
The Result Organization process applies reranking and formats the final response.

- Calculate section coverage
- Apply reranking logic
- Format response data
- Include context metadata

#### Scaling Considerations
- Advanced reranking models
- Enhanced response formats
- Feedback integration
- Custom scoring rules

## MVP Scale Support

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Error Detection
The Error Detection system monitors query execution and identifies processing issues.

- Query validation errors
- Search execution failures
- Scoring issues
- Response formatting problems

### Recovery Procedures
The Recovery system manages error recovery and query retry operations.

- Query retry logic
- Partial result handling
- Error response formatting
- Recovery logging

## Monitoring and Performance

### Query Monitoring
The Query Monitoring system tracks execution metrics and performance indicators.

- Query latency tracking
- Stage timing metrics
- Error rate monitoring
- Result quality metrics

### Performance Optimization
The Performance Optimization system manages query execution efficiency.

- Basic query caching
- Resource management
- Result size optimization
- Response formatting efficiency

#### Scaling Considerations
- Enhanced monitoring
- Advanced analytics
- Performance prediction
- Automated optimization
