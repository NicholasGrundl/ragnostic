Based on the files in `unittest_tree.md` and comparing with the source files in `src_tree.md`, help identify gaps in test coverage and create missing unit tests.

Analyze the files and share my thoughts in <thoughts> tags about:
* Current test coverage and organization
* Missing test files and test cases
* Test patterns being used
* Areas that need more testing
* Dependencies and fixtures that could be shared


Start by reading all the files and share analysis in <thoughts> tags:
```markdown
### Current Test Coverage
[Analysis of existing test files and coverage]

### Missing Tests
[List of source files without corresponding tests]

### Test Patterns
[Common patterns seen in existing tests]

### Areas Needing Coverage
[Specific functionality requiring tests]

### Shared Test Resources
[Fixtures and utilities that could be reused]
```

Next, ask which untested component you'd like to focus on first. For your chosen component, I'll help:
1. Create the appropriate test file structure 
2. Design test cases covering key functionality
3. Implement the tests using existing patterns
4. Set up required fixtures and mocks

<important>
When sharing <thoughts> make sure to:
- use markdown syntax
- add a newline after the tag to ensure proper formatting
</important>
