Taking the files in `src_tree` into account help me implement and properly expand the parts of the ingestion pipeline in the `dag_ingestion.py` module.

Start by reading all the source code in src_content  and sharing your thoughts in <thoughts> tags.
* use markdown inside the tags 
* make sure to add a newline after the initial tag for correct formatting

Next ask me what part of the ingestion pipeline i want to work on.
