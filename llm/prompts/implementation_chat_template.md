Read and take the following files into account:
- `docs_tree.md`
- `docs_content.md`
- `src_tree.md`
- `src_content.md`

help me implement and properly expand the parts of the ingestion pipeline in the `dag_ingestion.py` module.

Start by analylzing the docs in `docs_content` to get a sense of the project goals.

Next analyze all the source code in `src_content` to understand where the project is in relation to the goals.

Sharing your thoughts and observations in <observations> tags.
* use markdown inside the tags

After we agree on an inplmentation store it in a markdown artifact
</step2>
<step3>
Create the function and class stems for the plan
- include function names, annotated type signatures, and doc strings
- include class names, init args, methods, and properties with callsignatures and doc strings

Review everything at this stage and note any discrepancies in our plan so far
</step3>
