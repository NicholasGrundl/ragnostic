# Task Memory

## Current Task
Creating a comprehensive design document for document processing implementation that combines ingestion and storage systems for review and feedback.

## Document Analysis Summary

### Documents Reviewed
1. 2_Ragnostic_Project_Plan.md - Master project plan
2. 3_Document Ingestion System Technical Specification.md - Ingestion system details
3. 4_Raw Storage and Document Management Technical Specification.md - Storage system details

### Key Observations

#### Alignments
1. The technical specifications align well with Phase 1 of the project plan
2. Document types and processing flow are consistent across all documents
3. Modular architecture is maintained throughout
4. MVP scale requirements are clearly defined and consistent:
   - 25 Wikipedia articles
   - 1 textbook (200 pages)
   - 2 journal articles

#### Areas Needing Attention
1. Document classification mechanism needs more detail
2. Integration points between ingestion and storage systems need clarification
3. Error handling and recovery procedures across system boundaries
4. Metadata schema synchronization between systems

## Next Steps
1. Create detailed implementation plan for document ingestion system
2. Define integration points between ingestion and storage
3. Establish concrete error handling procedures
4. Design metadata schema that works across both systems

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Initial document review completed
- [x] Analysis of relationships and gaps completed
- [x] Implementation plan creation (8_Document_Processing_Implementation_Plan.md)
- [x] System integration design (included in implementation plan)
- [x] Error handling procedures (defined in implementation plan)
- [x] Metadata schema design (SQL schema defined in implementation plan)

## Recent Updates
1. Created comprehensive implementation plan combining ingestion and storage systems
2. Defined detailed database schema for document management
3. Specified parser output formats and storage structure
4. Established error handling and monitoring procedures

## Design Document Status
- Created comprehensive implementation plan (8_Document_Processing_Implementation_Plan.md)
- Document awaiting review and feedback
- Key areas for review:
  1. Database schema design
  2. File organization structure
  3. Parser output formats
  4. Error handling approach
  5. Monitoring strategy

## Questions to Address
1. Should we implement additional document classification beyond the basic doc_type?
2. Do we need to support any additional file formats in the MVP?
3. Should we consider any additional metadata fields for specific document types?
4. What should be the priority order for implementing the different components?
